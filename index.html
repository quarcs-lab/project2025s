<meta name="citation_abstract" content="Using satellite nighttime light data as proxy for economic activity, Chanda and Kabiraj (2020, World Development) studied regional growth and convergence across 520 districts in India. Based on a reproducible open-science approach, this article builds on their work by confirming and extending their main findings in three fronts. First, we illustrate regional convergence patterns using an interactive web-based tool for satellite image visualization. Second, we assess the degree of spatial dependence in their main econometric specification. Third, we employ a spatial Durbin model to measure the role of spatial spillovers in the convergence process. Our results indicate that spatial spillovers significantly increase the speed of regional convergence. Overall, the results emphasize the role of spatial dependence in regional convergence through the lens of satellite imagery, interactive visualizations, and spillover modeling.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Decentralization and regional convergence: Evidence from nighttime lights;,citation_abstract=This paper investigates the longstanding debate over whether fiscal and administrative decentralization promotes regional convergence or exacerbates spatial inequalities within countries. Proponents of decentralization argue that devolving authority to subnational governments enhances local accountability, improves the match between public goods provision and local preferences, and thereby spurs economic growth in lagging regions. Critics counter that decentralization may amplify spatial inequalities by empowering better-endowed localities that possess stronger fiscal capacity and institutional capabilities to exploit devolved powers more effectively than disadvantaged regions. Empirical tests of this tradeoff have historically been constrained by the scarcity of comparable subnational income statistics in developing countries, limiting generalization beyond developed-country settings and conventional administrative data sources. To address this empirical gap, we pair satellite-derived nighttime light intensity data with a novel cross-country database that records the extent and institutionalization of decentralization as codified in national laws and formal institutional arrangements. The theoretical framework conceptualizes decentralization as a policy instrument that alters the allocation of fiscal responsibilities and decision-making authority across national and subnational tiers of government, with competing effects on regional growth dynamics. On one hand, local responsiveness may promote public goods and investments where they are most productive; on the other hand, local capture and heterogeneity in local fiscal capacity may lead to divergence as wealthier regions exploit devolved powers more effectively. Because administrative income series are limited in many countries, we rely on nighttime lights as a spatially comparable proxy for economic activity that permits analysis at the first and second administrative levels across a global sample of countries. The empirical engine combines satellite nighttime luminosity measurements with the decentralization database compiled from national laws and formal institutional arrangements, enabling cross-country variation in de jure decentralization exposure. We examine regional convergence by studying the dispersion and growth dynamics of nightlight-based proxies for income across subnational units within countries, comparing patterns before and after decentralization and across different institutional contexts. The central empirical finding is that decentralization—measured from legal and institutional records—tends to hinder within-country regional convergence as captured by nightlight intensity, with the adverse effect being more pronounced in developing countries. This result suggests that devolved authority may magnify existing capacity and resource differences across subnational units unless countervailing transfers or equalizing fiscal mechanisms are present. The findings imply caution for policymakers: decentralization reforms can have heterogeneous distributional consequences and may exacerbate spatial inequality when local fiscal resources and institutional capacity are unequally distributed. Policymakers considering devolution should therefore pair decentralization with mechanisms to support capacity building and fiscal equalization, especially in lower-income settings. Methodologically, the paper contributes by demonstrating how satellite luminosity and legal institutional measures can be combined to study subnational development dynamics at scale, addressing an empirical void when conventional income data are lacking. Conceptually, the study adds to the literature by producing cross-country evidence that the distributional effects of decentralization depend on national context and subnational capacity, thereby informing debates about the design of intergovernmental fiscal systems and local governance reforms.;,citation_author=Bibek Adhikari;,citation_author=Ramesh Dhital;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2020.102467;,citation_volume=145;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Development Economics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rural roads and local economic development;,citation_abstract=This paper investigates the causal impact of improved rural connectivity on structural transformation in India’s countryside by estimating the effects of a large national rural road construction program on employment composition, firm dynamics, and agricultural outcomes. The research addresses a fundamental question in development economics: can infrastructure investments that reduce transport costs and improve market access catalyze economic transformation in rural areas by facilitating the movement of workers out of low-productivity agriculture into higher-productivity nonfarm activities? The context is India’s Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), a massive rural road program launched in 2000 that aimed to provide all-weather road connectivity to unconnected villages. We exploit administrative allocation rules and quasi-experimental variation in road placement to infer market-access effects that follow infrastructure upgrades. The identification strategy takes advantage of program allocation rules that created discontinuities in treatment probability based on village characteristics, producing quasi-experimental variation in market access across villages. The empirical framework estimates treatment effects of improved market access on local labor market outcomes and firm dynamics using detailed microdata from comprehensive household and firm censuses that track worker flows, employment composition, and firm counts across treated and control villages over multiple years. The data infrastructure combines administrative records on road construction timing and placement with nationally representative household surveys and economic censuses that provide detailed information on employment, earnings, firm size, and agricultural production at the village level. A clear result is that road upgrades induced measurable movement of workers out of agriculture into nonfarm employment in the rural economy, consistent with structural transformation at the local level. Specifically, we find that villages receiving road upgrades experienced significant increases in the share of workers employed in manufacturing, services, and other nonfarm activities, with corresponding declines in agricultural employment shares. Despite this labor reallocation, we find limited evidence that agricultural productivity, yields, or aggregate agricultural incomes increased as a consequence of the roads within the observable timeframe. This pattern suggests that roads primarily facilitated labor mobility rather than transforming agricultural production itself. The research also finds only modest village-level firm expansion following road upgrades: while firm size indicators rose in some specifications—suggesting firms were inefficiently small prior to improved market access—there was not a broad proliferation of new village firms across treated areas. Complementarity results indicate that roads were most effective in stimulating local nonfarm activity when other enabling inputs such as electricity were present, pointing to important interaction effects among infrastructure investments. The pattern of rapid labor reallocation from agriculture without immediate gains in agricultural outcomes or broad income increases implies that road connectivity can accelerate structural change by facilitating access to nonfarm employment opportunities, but may not be sufficient alone to raise agricultural productivity or rural household incomes in the short run. Policy implications include the need to pair road investments with complementary interventions such as electrification, skills development, credit access, and firm development supports to translate improved market access into sustained income gains and broader firm entry. The findings caution that infrastructure that lowers transport costs can shift labor patterns and firm dynamics but may require additional policies to realize agricultural modernization and inclusive income growth. This work contributes to the infrastructure and development literature by providing credible causal estimates of rural road impacts using large-scale microdata and quasi-experimental methods, and by documenting the channels through which connectivity affects structural transformation in rural economies.;,citation_author=Sam Asher;,citation_author=Paul Novosad;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1257/aer.20180268;,citation_volume=110;,citation_journal_title=American Economic Review;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lights out? COVID-19 containment policies and economic activity;,citation_abstract=The COVID-19 pandemic posed an acute challenge for real-time economic measurement because official statistics such as GDP and employment figures are released with substantial delays, often months or quarters after the reference period, which hampers timely policy responses during rapidly evolving crises. Household income and firm revenue data from surveys are similarly slow to collect and process, creating an urgent need for high-frequency alternative indicators that can provide near-real-time assessments of economic activity at granular geographic scales. This paper adopts a suite of alternative high-frequency indicators—most notably satellite nighttime light intensity, mobility metrics derived from mobile phone data, migration flow indicators, and household income and consumption survey responses—to estimate how containment policies and the pandemic itself affected economic activity at the district level in India during the critical months of 2020. We focus on India because it implemented one of the world’s strictest and most sudden lockdowns, creating sharp variation in containment stringency across districts and over time that can be exploited for identification. The empirical approach uses district-level nighttime light intensity as a spatially granular proxy for economic activity, complemented by mobility and migration indicators and household survey measures of income and consumption to investigate transmission channels. Nighttime lights have been validated in prior literature as correlating strongly with economic output, making them a useful real-time proxy when official GDP data are unavailable. We implement a difference-in-differences framework that compares districts subject to different levels of containment stringency over time, thereby isolating the effect of more severe restrictions from common time trends affecting all districts. The containment stringency index is constructed from administrative data on lockdown phases, movement restrictions, and business closures, allowing us to classify districts into high, medium, and low stringency categories. The study documents that during the post-lockdown period from May to July 2020, districts facing the most severe containment restrictions exhibited 9.3 percent lower nighttime light intensity compared to districts with the least restrictive measures. Using an empirical mapping between nighttime lights and GDP estimated from pre-pandemic data, this decline in luminosity corresponds to an implied GDP loss on the order of 12.4 to 18.6 percent relative to less restricted areas, highlighting the substantial economic costs of stringent containment. Districts with intermediate restrictions experienced smaller declines of around 1.5 percent lower light intensity relative to the least restricted districts. The largest divergence in nighttime lights occurred in May 2020 during the graded lockdown phase and tapered in June and July as restrictions eased and economic adaptation progressed. The economic impacts of containment were spatially heterogeneous: stricter containment led to larger declines in economic activity in districts with greater population density, older populations, and a higher share of employment in services. This heterogeneity is consistent with both the direct effects of shutdowns on service-intensive economies and the greater susceptibility of densely populated urban districts to activity losses when mobility is restricted. We explore plausible transmission channels and provide evidence that reduced household income and consumption plausibly transmit the observed luminosity declines, and that mobility and migration dynamics also play important roles in local activity changes. Mobility data show sharp drops in movement during lockdown periods, and migration data reveal substantial return migration from urban to rural areas, both of which correlate with declines in nighttime lights. The paper demonstrates the utility of combining satellite nightlight data with mobility and household measures to produce near-real-time assessments of economic shocks at subnational scales, enabling more targeted and timely policy responses when official GDP and employment statistics are not yet available. By quantifying heterogeneous effects across districts and linking them to demographic and economic structure, the study provides actionable insights for prioritizing support and tailoring exit strategies from lockdowns. The findings contribute to the growing literature on using alternative data sources for economic monitoring and underscore the value of high-frequency, spatially disaggregated indicators for crisis management and policy evaluation.;,citation_author=Robert C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The GST and regional divergence in india: A nightlights perspective;,citation_abstract=This paper addresses whether India’s goods and services tax (GST) architecture could alter pre-existing regional income patterns and potentially exacerbate divergence between prosperous and lagging regions. The GST, implemented in 2017, represents a fundamental reform that replaced a complex web of central and state-level indirect taxes with a unified national tax system, thereby tightening economic integration across state borders and removing many fiscal levers previously available to subnational governments. We frame the research question in terms of how deeper national market integration interacts with place-specific fiscal capacities and the spatial distribution of economic activity to potentially reshape regional inequality. India exhibits substantial subnational heterogeneity in income per capita and economic activity, which matters critically for equity and policy design. We argue that national-level reforms that remove tax and fiscal instruments from subnational governments can have heterogeneous effects across places depending on existing industrial structure, connectivity to markets, and fiscal capacities. Empirical assessment of these spatial effects requires geographically detailed measures of economic activity that are not available from official statistics, which are often aggregated at the state level and released with long delays. To construct spatially fine-grained measures, we rely on satellite nightlight luminosity data, using the premise that modern sensors capture variations in light intensity that correlate strongly with local economic output. This approach is consistent with the broader literature that validates nightlight-derived measures as useful proxies for regional income where official data are sparse or irregularly available. The analysis uses nightlight luminosity data as a proxy for economic activity and income per capita at subnational spatial units, situating this choice within recent practice that maps luminosity into income estimates when administrative GDP series are unavailable or inconsistent. The empirical work examines disparities at two levels: inter-state comparisons to document broad differences across India’s large states, and intra-state spatial dispersion to document how uneven activity is within state borders. Rather than claiming causal estimates of GST’s impact—which would require ex ante and post-reform experimental variation that is not yet available given the recent implementation—we outline theoretical channels and use the spatial distribution of lights to simulate which regions may gain or lose under alternative integration scenarios and fiscal configurations. We document meaningful dispersion in nightlight-derived per capita activity across and inside states, with clear core-periphery patterns in several large states. We use the luminosity-based metric to quantify these differences and show that intra-state inequality sometimes rivals inter-state gaps, highlighting the importance of within-state spatial heterogeneity that is often masked in state-level aggregates. A central theoretical concern is that deeper market integration via a uniform national GST could amplify spatial polarization if subnational fiscal and investment tools are diminished or if agglomeration forces concentrate activity in already-dominant urban cores. We stress that tighter goods-market integration, combined with softer local fiscal instruments, may lead to faster growth in already well-connected, high-density urban cores and relative stagnation in disadvantaged peripheries. The paper situates its nightlights-based measures among other satellite-based approaches and shows consistency with general luminosity-income correlations found in the literature, while acknowledging limitations of sensor saturation in bright urban areas and the need for calibration when mapping lights to monetary units. Policy implications emphasize the need for place-based policies that target lagging areas and preserve subnational capacities for investment and redistribution. We recommend targeted infrastructure spending and fiscal transfers that explicitly account for intra-state dispersion rather than only equalizing across states, and we stress the importance of retaining or designing compensatory fiscal tools at substate levels so that integration does not remove instruments that support peripheral regions. In sum, we combine nightlight-derived activity measures with a spatial diagnostic of inequality to argue that GST-style integration could risk increasing spatial polarization unless paired with place-sensitive fiscal arrangements and investments that offset agglomeration pressures and support convergence in disadvantaged regions.;,citation_author=Shankha Chakravarty;,citation_author=Rajeev Dehejia;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=42;,citation_volume=54;,citation_journal_title=Economic and Political Weekly;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Demonetization and its redistributive effects: Evidence from india;,citation_abstract=This paper examines the redistributive consequences of India’s sudden demonetization policy announced in November 2016, which invalidated 86 percent of currency in circulation overnight and required citizens to exchange old notes for new currency through the banking system. The policy was justified as a measure to combat corruption, tax evasion, and counterfeit currency, but it created an unprecedented shock to liquidity and transaction costs that affected different regions and socioeconomic groups heterogeneously. We investigate how this monetary shock propagated through the economy and whether it had differential impacts across the income distribution and across regions with varying levels of financial inclusion and economic structure. The research question is motivated by the observation that demonetization represented a massive, unanticipated intervention that disrupted normal economic activity for several months, with potential for both aggregate output losses and significant redistributive effects if the costs and benefits were unevenly distributed. To measure economic impacts at high frequency and fine spatial resolution, we combine multiple data sources including satellite nighttime lights as a proxy for local economic activity, household survey data on income and consumption, banking statistics on deposit flows and financial access, and administrative data on employment and firm activity. Nighttime lights provide a spatially granular, high-frequency indicator that allows us to track district-level economic activity on a monthly basis during the demonetization period and compare it to pre-shock trends and to control regions. The identification strategy exploits spatial and temporal variation in exposure to the demonetization shock, leveraging differences across districts in pre-existing cash intensity, banking penetration, and sectoral composition to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects. We implement difference-in-differences and event-study designs that compare changes in nighttime lights and other outcomes in more cash-dependent districts versus less cash-dependent districts before and after the demonetization announcement. The empirical findings document significant short-run declines in nighttime light intensity in districts that were more reliant on cash transactions and had lower banking penetration, consistent with disruptions to economic activity when liquidity constraints bind. The magnitude of the decline varied across districts, with rural and less financially included areas experiencing larger drops in luminosity. We also find evidence of heterogeneous effects across the income distribution: poorer households and informal sector workers, who rely more heavily on cash and have less access to banking services, experienced larger income and consumption losses during the demonetization period. Survey data reveal declines in household consumption and increases in financial distress among disadvantaged groups, while wealthier households with better access to banking were better able to smooth consumption. The redistributive effects are further evidenced by changes in labor market outcomes, with informal employment and daily wages declining more sharply in cash-intensive districts. Over time, some of these effects dissipated as new currency was gradually introduced and households adapted, but the initial shock had persistent consequences for vulnerable populations. The paper contributes to the literature on monetary shocks, financial inclusion, and the distributional consequences of macroeconomic policies by providing credible causal evidence on how a large-scale demonetization affects different segments of society. The findings underscore the importance of considering distributional impacts when designing and implementing macroeconomic interventions, and they highlight the risks of policies that impose sudden liquidity constraints in economies with large informal sectors and limited financial infrastructure. Policy implications include the need for gradual implementation, complementary measures to support vulnerable groups, and investments in financial inclusion to mitigate adverse redistributive effects of future monetary reforms.;,citation_author=Areendam Chanda;,citation_author=Justin Cook;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2022.102835;,citation_volume=156;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Development Economics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Shedding light on regional growth and convergence in india;,citation_abstract=This paper uses district-level unsaturated nightlight data to revisit the widely discussed puzzle that India appears to exhibit divergent growth at the state level while smaller spatial units sometimes show convergence patterns. The literature on Indian regional growth has documented persistent and widening disparities across states in per capita income since economic liberalization in 1991, leading to concerns about spatial polarization and uneven development. However, aggregation to the state level may mask important convergence dynamics operating at finer spatial scales. We study a panel of 520 Indian districts over the period 1996 to 2010 and report strong evidence of absolute convergence at the district scale, meaning that districts with lower initial levels of economic activity tended to grow faster over the sample period. The analysis decomposes growth into rural and urban components, documents faster rural growth as a key contributor to convergence, and shows that districts disadvantaged by geography—such as those farther from the coast, with lower agricultural suitability, and with more rugged terrain—tend to grow faster, consistent with catch-up dynamics in places that start from lower baselines. The spatial and temporal coverage of the analysis encompasses 520 districts spanning 1996 to 2010, and we use unsaturated satellite nightlight time series as the principal indicator of local economic activity. The rationale for using unsaturated nightlight data is to avoid ceiling effects in bright urban cores that can mask growth variation; this choice improves measurement of growth in both low- and mid-intensity locations and is linked to prior validations of luminosity as a proxy for regional economic activity where official GDP series are limited or unavailable at the district level. The central empirical result is evidence of absolute convergence across the 520-district panel: districts with lower initial luminosity levels tended to grow faster over the sample period, with an estimated convergence rate that is economically meaningful and statistically robust. Decomposing growth into rural and urban components, we find that faster growth in rural areas is a primary driver of the observed convergence. Rural luminosity growth rates outpaced urban growth in many districts, narrowing the initial rural-urban gaps and contributing to overall district-level convergence. This finding contrasts with narratives of urban-led growth and suggests that rural areas have been catching up, possibly due to infrastructure investments, agricultural productivity improvements, and rural development programs implemented during this period. We also examine the role of geographic disadvantage and find that districts that were relatively disadvantaged geographically—farther from the coast, with lower agricultural suitability, and with more rugged terrain—tended to exhibit more rapid luminosity growth, consistent with catch-up dynamics where poorer or less-favored locations grow faster from a low base. This result suggests that geographic barriers, while initially constraining development, did not prevent convergence and may have been offset by targeted policies or by the diffusion of technology and infrastructure to remote areas. The paper explicitly contrasts its district-level convergence result with the dominant narrative of inter-state divergence and offers reasons why unit of analysis matters. Smaller spatial units can reveal local catch-up and diffusion effects that aggregate up to divergent state-level outcomes if gains concentrate in particular districts within lagging states. Other recent work has noted the same empirical tension and offered frameworks that allow both patterns to coexist—for instance, analyses that detect club convergence or other heterogeneous growth dynamics across spatial scales find that divergence at higher aggregation can coexist with convergence among a larger set of smaller units. Robustness checks include testing for sensitivity to sensor saturation, alternative aggregation choices, and controls for policy initiatives during the sample period; the key convergence findings remain robust to these checks. Policy implications emphasize the value of district-level analysis for targeting development interventions: because catch-up appears to operate at substate scales and is often driven by rural improvements and convergence in geographically disadvantaged districts, policies that focus on connectivity, rural services, and constraints specific to geographically disadvantaged places can accelerate broader convergence.

The program was launched in 2006 and phased in across districts over several years, creating plausible quasi-experimental variation in exposure that can be exploited for causal identification. While a large literature has documented the direct income and employment effects of NREGS on participating households, less is known about the program’s aggregate impacts on local economic activity, including general equilibrium effects on wages, private employment, and overall output. This paper addresses that gap by combining nighttime lights data as a high-frequency, spatially granular proxy for economic activity with household survey data and administrative program records to estimate the causal impact of NREGS on district-level economic outcomes. The research question is motivated by the observation that public works programs can have effects that extend beyond direct transfers to participants: by injecting income into rural economies and altering local labor markets, such programs may generate multiplier effects, crowd out or crowd in private employment, and shift the composition of economic activity. Understanding these aggregate effects is critical for evaluating the overall welfare impact and cost-effectiveness of large-scale public works interventions. The identification strategy exploits the staggered rollout of NREGS across districts, using a difference-in-differences framework that compares changes in nighttime lights and other outcomes in districts that received the program earlier versus later, conditional on district and time fixed effects. This approach isolates the causal effect of program exposure from common trends and time-invariant district characteristics. We also control for district-specific trends and conduct robustness checks using alternative specifications and placebo tests to ensure that the estimated effects are not driven by pre-existing differential trends or confounding factors. The data infrastructure combines satellite nighttime lights aggregated to the district level on a monthly or annual basis, household survey data from the National Sample Survey and other sources that provide information on employment, wages, and consumption, and administrative data on NREGS implementation including person-days of employment generated and expenditures by district and year. The nighttime lights data allow us to construct a continuous, high-frequency measure of local economic activity that is available for all districts and can capture changes in output and consumption that may not be immediately reflected in survey-based measures. The main empirical findings indicate that NREGS had modest positive aggregate effects on district-level economic activity as measured by nighttime lights, with the magnitude of the effect varying across districts depending on implementation quality, local economic structure, and initial levels of development. On average, districts that received NREGS experienced small increases in luminosity relative to control districts, consistent with positive income effects and local multipliers. However, the aggregate effects were heterogeneous: districts with better program implementation, higher participation rates, and more complementary infrastructure saw larger gains, while districts with weaker implementation or higher initial income levels showed smaller or insignificant effects. We also find evidence that the program had differential impacts on poorer versus richer districts, with some specifications suggesting that the poorest districts—where implementation challenges were most severe—did not experience significant aggregate gains, raising concerns about targeting and program effectiveness in the most disadvantaged areas. Decomposing the channels, we find that NREGS increased household incomes and consumption among participating households, and there is evidence of positive spillovers to local labor markets through higher agricultural wages and increased demand for goods and services. However, we also find some evidence of crowding out of private employment in certain contexts, particularly in districts where the program wage was set above market-clearing levels, which may have reduced labor supply to private firms and agriculture. The net effect on aggregate output depends on the balance between these positive income and multiplier effects and any negative crowding-out effects. The findings contribute to the literature on public works programs, fiscal multipliers, and the aggregate effects of social safety nets by providing credible causal estimates using high-frequency spatial data and quasi-experimental methods. The results underscore the importance of implementation quality and local context in determining the aggregate impacts of large-scale transfer programs, and they highlight the value of using alternative data sources such as nighttime lights to measure economic activity at scales and frequencies not available from traditional surveys. Policy implications include the need to improve program implementation and targeting to maximize aggregate benefits, to consider general equilibrium effects when designing and evaluating public works programs, and to pair such programs with complementary investments in infrastructure and skills to enhance their effectiveness in promoting local economic development.;,citation_author=Justin Cook;,citation_author=Manisha Shah;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1162/rest_a_00951;,citation_volume=104;,citation_journal_title=Review of Economics and Statistics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Growth, technological interdependence and spatial externalities: Theory and evidence;,citation_abstract=This paper develops a theoretical growth framework that embeds interdependence of technological progress across economies via spatial externalities, and translates that theory into estimable spatial-econometric reduced forms to test for the presence and magnitude of cross-country technological spillovers. The motivation stems from the observation that technological progress and knowledge diffusion do not respect national borders, and that countries may benefit from innovations and capital accumulation in neighboring or technologically similar countries through various channels including trade, foreign direct investment, and disembodied knowledge flows. Existing growth models typically treat countries as isolated units, ignoring these interdependencies, which may lead to biased estimates of convergence rates and misspecified models of the growth process. We extend the neoclassical growth framework to allow for technological interdependence, where an economy’s productivity depends not only on its own capital accumulation and technology but also on spatially weighted capital and technology in other economies. The model structure allows for interdependent technological progress and multiple capital stocks, yielding steady-state relationships where an economy’s output depends on its own capital accumulation and on spatially weighted capital and technology in other economies. Spatial externalities enter as disembodied knowledge diffusion or pecuniary and technology spillovers that operate through a connectivity matrix mapping inter-regional or inter-country closeness. The theoretical setup is general enough to accommodate various forms of spatial dependence and can be nested within standard growth accounting frameworks. The empirical translation of the theoretical model yields a spatially augmented growth equation that takes the form of a spatial Durbin or spatial lag specification, enabling separate estimation of direct own-region effects and indirect spillover effects transmitted through the weight matrix. The choice of weight matrix is central to the empirical implementation: we use geographic-distance-based weights in the baseline specification, where the weight between two countries is inversely related to the distance between them, reflecting the idea that technological spillovers decay with geographic distance. We also explore alternative weight matrices based on technological or trade proximity to test the robustness of the results to different notions of closeness. The estimation uses cross-sectional and panel data on GDP per capita, physical capital stocks, human capital, and population growth for a large sample of countries over several decades. We employ spatial econometric techniques that account for endogenous spatial lags and potential measurement error in connectivity measures, including maximum likelihood and instrumental variables methods. The main empirical findings indicate measurable spatial externalities in the growth process: countries’ growth rates and income levels are significantly affected by the capital stocks and technological progress of neighboring or proximate countries, even after controlling for own-country fundamentals. The estimated coefficients on spatially lagged variables are statistically significant and economically meaningful, suggesting that ignoring spatial interdependence leads to misspecified models and biased inference about convergence and the sources of growth. However, subsequent robustness checks by other researchers have shown that the magnitude and significance of these spatial externalities can be sensitive to the choice of weight matrix, data vintage, and model specification. For example, using genetic-distance-based weights instead of geographic distance can alter the estimated spillover effects, and some specifications yield implausibly large capital shares or insignificant spillovers under alternative data revisions. These robustness exercises reveal that while spatial externalities are an important empirical hypothesis, their estimated magnitude and the inference about physical capital externalities at steady state are conditional on modeling choices. The theoretical framing allows for parameter heterogeneity and conditional convergence arguments because technological interdependence and local fundamentals jointly determine steady states. Robust estimation requires careful attention to endogenous spatial lags, potential measurement error in connectivity measures, and sensitivity to data revisions—factors that can alter conclusions about whether spatial spillovers materially sustain persistent regional disparities or reinforce convergence. The paper contributes to the spatial econometrics and growth literature by formally linking spatial externalities to growth dynamics and deriving testable reduced-form spatial specifications. The findings support the conceptual importance of spatial externalities for growth and convergence analyses, but also caution that empirical magnitudes are fragile to modeling choices. Users of spatial growth models should therefore conduct sensitivity checks across plausible weight matrices and data vintages, and interpret estimated externalities with care. Where significant spatial dependence is found, the results highlight how technological interdependence can generate persistent spatial patterns of income through spillovers, but the quantitative conclusions require robustness and careful economic interpretation.;,citation_author=Cem Ertur;,citation_author=Wilfried Koch;,citation_publication_date=2007;,citation_cover_date=2007;,citation_year=2007;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1002/jae.963;,citation_volume=22;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Applied Econometrics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A spatial mankiw-romer-weil model: Theory and evidence;,citation_abstract=This paper extends the classic Mankiw-Romer-Weil (MRW) neoclassical growth framework to incorporate disembodied knowledge diffusion across regions, operationalized as spatial externalities, and then maps the theoretical steady-state relationships into a spatial-econometric reduced form consistent with a spatial Durbin model. The MRW model is a cornerstone of empirical growth research, augmenting the Solow model with human capital and providing a tractable framework for testing convergence hypotheses and estimating the contributions of physical capital, human capital, and population growth to cross-country income differences. However, the standard MRW framework treats regions or countries as isolated units, ignoring the possibility that productivity and technological progress in one region may spill over to neighboring or technologically similar regions through knowledge diffusion, trade linkages, or labor mobility. We formulate a spatially augmented MRW model in which regional output per worker at steady state depends on conventional MRW determinants—physical capital accumulation, human capital investment, and population growth—plus spatially transmitted productivity terms that capture knowledge diffusion between regions. Disembodied knowledge spillovers are modeled such that a region’s productivity can be raised by technological activity in other, technologically proximate regions, consistent with theoretical notions of cross-region learning and knowledge externalities. The theoretical innovation lies in embedding these spatial externalities within the well-understood MRW accounting framework, yielding a model that is both theoretically grounded and empirically tractable. The reduced-form empirical model corresponds to a spatial Durbin specification that includes both spatial lags of the dependent variable and spatially lagged covariates, permitting estimation of how changes in determinants in one region affect both that region and others via the spatial multiplier. A key methodological contribution is the emphasis on interpreting results through impact measures—direct, indirect, and total effects—following the approach of LeSage and Pace, to correctly quantify the amplitude and sign of spillovers and to avoid mistaken inference about capital externalities that can arise from naive inspection of regression coefficients. The spatial Durbin model allows for rich patterns of spatial dependence and nests simpler spatial lag and spatial error models as special cases, making it a flexible and robust specification for testing spatial growth hypotheses. The empirical analysis uses a panel of 198 NUTS2 regions across 22 European countries over the period 1995 to 2004, enabling tests of cross-region technological interdependence while controlling for regional fundamentals and exploiting panel methods to address unobserved heterogeneity. The data include regional GDP per worker, physical capital stocks estimated from investment data, human capital measured by educational attainment, and population growth rates. Technological proximity or connectivity is operationalized through a weight matrix constructed from measures of technological similarity across regions, reflecting the idea that spillovers are stronger between regions with similar technological profiles or industrial structures. The estimation delivers measurable direct effects of MRW determinants on regional output per worker—physical capital, human capital, and population growth all have the expected signs and magnitudes consistent with the MRW framework—and statistically significant indirect spillovers attributable to cross-region technological interdependence. The indirect effects indicate that policy-relevant inputs in one region, such as investments in physical or human capital, can have measurable positive impacts on neighboring or technologically similar regions, highlighting the importance of accounting for spatial interdependence when evaluating regional policies. The impact-based decomposition shows that ignoring spatial feedbacks would underestimate the total effect of regional investments and lead to incorrect policy conclusions. The paper stresses that the interpretation of spillovers requires the impact-based decomposition: naive coefficient inspection can misrepresent the economic size and direction of externalities because of spatial feedback loops that amplify or dampen direct effects. By embedding MRW fundamentals within a spatial Durbin framework and empirically separating direct from indirect impacts, the paper provides a tractable bridge between canonical growth theory and spatial-econometric practice, offering a template for measuring how regional accumulation and technology interact in a spatially interconnected environment. The contribution to spatial growth theory lies in operationalizing disembodied technological spillovers within a well-understood growth accounting framework, empirically demonstrating that cross-region interdependence matters for regional output levels, and showing that rigorous impact decomposition is necessary for correct substantive inference. The findings have important policy implications: regional development policies should account for spillover effects, and investments in one region can generate benefits in neighboring regions, suggesting potential gains from coordinated regional policies and the importance of considering spatial externalities when designing growth-promoting interventions.;,citation_author=Manfred M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Growth in regions;,citation_abstract=This paper analyzes subnational growth across 1,528 regions in 83 countries to show that regional convergence is a robust empirical regularity and to identify the key determinants of regional growth, including geography, human capital, and capital-market quality. The motivation stems from the observation that national-level aggregates can mask important within-country heterogeneity that matters for policy, welfare, and growth theory. By assembling a harmonized sample of subnational regions, we create the scope needed to compare growth dynamics inside countries with growth dynamics across countries and to test whether textbook convergence patterns apply at the regional scale. The dataset represents a major data collection effort, harmonizing regional definitions, income measures, and demographic variables across diverse countries and administrative systems to produce a consistent cross-section of 1,528 regions. This broad cross-section allows us to separate country-level shocks and institutions from local geographic and human-capital endowments that shape regional trajectories. Empirical findings are a central contribution: we estimate regional growth regressions and find a regional convergence rate around 2 percent per year, a magnitude broadly comparable to commonly reported national convergence rates, implying that lower-level units are, on average, catching up to richer regions albeit slowly. Importantly, the paper contrasts convergence within countries to convergence across countries and reports that convergence is systematically faster inside countries that are themselves richer and inside countries with more developed capital markets. This pattern suggests that country-level institutions and financial integration matter for allowing regions to exploit diffusion and factor adjustment channels that generate catch-up growth. The paper also documents which regional characteristics correlate with faster or slower growth: geography and human capital are two main channels. Geographic advantages such as coastal access, favorable climate, and flat terrain are associated with higher regional growth, while regions with higher human-capital stocks—measured by educational attainment and literacy rates—grow faster conditional on initial income. These correlates are interpreted not only as direct productivity drivers but also as factors that relax frictions to trade, migration, and knowledge diffusion. To interpret these patterns structurally, the authors calibrate a neoclassical growth model to the regional evidence. The calibration assesses how much of observed persistence and slow convergence can be explained by standard capital accumulation and diminishing returns, and how much must be attributed to impediments to factor mobility or to spatially varying productivity. The quantitative exercise indicates that to reconcile the observed regional persistence and cross-region differentials with a neoclassical framework requires nontrivial barriers to mobility of capital and labor or substantial spatial differences in productivity and returns. In short, the calibration implies that frictionless factor mobility is inconsistent with the regional dynamics in the data, and that observed regional disparities are plausibly sustained by barriers that limit reallocation and diffusion. Key implications include the following: regions’ growth is not purely a function of national growth; country policies that improve capital-market depth and reduce frictions can accelerate within-country convergence. Geography and human capital matter both as direct productivity determinants and as mediators of market access and factor movements. Standard neoclassical mechanisms can explain part of the evidence, but calibration points to the importance of incorporating mobility frictions or spatially heterogeneous productivities when using regional data to inform policy. The paper contributes to the regional and development economics literature by providing the first large-scale, cross-country analysis of subnational growth dynamics, by documenting robust convergence at the regional level, and by identifying the roles of geography, human capital, and institutions in shaping regional trajectories. The findings have important policy implications for regional development strategies, suggesting that investments in education, infrastructure to improve market access, and financial sector development can promote convergence and reduce spatial inequalities within countries.;,citation_author=Nicola Gennaioli;,citation_author=Rafael La Porta;,citation_author=Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes;,citation_author=Andrei Shleifer;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1007/s10887-014-9105-9;,citation_volume=19;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Economic Growth;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Measuring economic growth from outer space;,citation_abstract=This paper develops a statistical framework for optimally combining satellite-observed nighttime lights with official national accounts data to improve measurement of economic growth, especially in countries where official statistics are unreliable or unavailable. The authors begin from a measurement problem: official national accounts can be unreliable or sporadically revised in many countries, particularly in the developing world, while satellite-observed nighttime luminosity provides a geographically fine-grained, consistently measured indicator of economic activity that is available globally and updated frequently. The key insight is to treat official income growth and lights-based growth as two noisy signals of an underlying true growth process, and then derive an optimal composite estimator that combines the two sources according to their relative signal-to-noise ratios. This framework permits the data to determine how much weight to place on official statistics versus lights, rather than imposing an a priori choice, and it provides a principled statistical solution to reconciling potentially conflicting information sources. The theoretical foundation rests on a measurement model in which true income growth is unobserved and both official GDP growth and nighttime lights growth are noisy proxies. The optimal weights are derived by minimizing the mean squared error of the composite estimator, which depends on the variances of measurement errors in each source and the covariance between true growth and each proxy. The authors estimate these parameters using data from countries with relatively reliable national accounts, where both lights and official GDP are available, and then apply the estimated weights to construct composite growth estimates for all countries. A practical outcome from the estimation is that for countries with weak or noisy national accounts—identified by indicators such as low statistical capacity, infrequent surveys, and poor governance—the lights-based series should receive substantial weight, often comparable to the official series, reflecting similar information content. For countries with reliable accounts, the official series dominates and receives most of the weight. The authors report that for a set of countries with poor national accounts, the optimal composite gives roughly equal weights to the official and lights-based growth estimates. When the composite is constructed, annual growth rates can differ from official statistics by economically meaningful amounts—up to about three percentage points per year in some cases—indicating that lights data can materially change inferences about recent growth episodes and country performance. Beyond improving national growth measurement, the method’s greatest practical advantage is geographical flexibility. Nighttime lights are observed at fine spatial granularities—down to approximately one square kilometer—so the composite approach can be used to estimate growth rates for subnational regions such as states, provinces, or districts, or for supranational aggregates such as cross-border regions or informal economic zones where official figures are absent or inconsistent. This permits analysis of spatial patterns of growth within countries and of growth in areas that do not correspond to administrative boundaries. An illustrative empirical application uses the lights-based series to compare coastal and hinterland growth patterns in sub-Saharan Africa, finding that coastal areas in that region are growing slower than inland hinterlands in the sample examined, a result that contrasts with common expectations and demonstrates how satellite-informed measurement can overturn conventional wisdom and provide new diagnostic information about spatial growth heterogeneity that is invisible in national aggregates. Methodologically, the paper makes several contributions: it formalizes how to combine noisy administrative data with independent remote sensing indicators, letting empirical variance and covariances determine weights; it provides a practical rule that where national accounts are weak, substantial weight should be given to lights-based estimates to improve growth inference; and it demonstrates that lights data permit estimating growth for any chosen geographic partition, enabling subnational and supranational comparisons and diagnostics for policy targeting. Robustness considerations are important: because lights imperfectly reflect activity in low-luminosity sectors such as extensive agriculture, the composite approach guards against systematic biases by blending two imperfect measures, each with different strengths and limitations. The paper contributes to the development economics and measurement literature by providing both a principled statistical solution and concrete evidence that combining lights and accounts changes growth estimates in important cases, and by opening a range of applications for researchers and policymakers interested in subnational growth, cross-border comparisons, and improved country-level growth measurement where official statistics are suspect.;,citation_author=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Colonial institutions and long-run development in india: Evidence from nightlights;,citation_abstract=This paper documents a persistent colonial-era development gap across Indian districts using nightlights per capita and shows that landlord-based revenue systems largely explain worse outcomes under direct British rule compared to areas under indirect rule. The research addresses a fundamental question in the political economy of development: do colonial institutions have long-lasting effects on economic outcomes, and if so, through what mechanisms? The historical context is that British colonial rule in India took two broad forms: direct rule, where the colonial state exercised administrative control and extracted revenues through state agencies and landlord intermediaries, and indirect rule, where local princes, zamindars, or princely states retained authority under British suzerainty. We exploit historical maps linking modern districts to whether they fell under direct colonial administration or indirect arrangements to create a binary institutional exposure variable used in empirical analysis. The paper pairs these institutional indicators with contemporary district-level measures of economic activity derived from satellite-observed nighttime luminosity adjusted per capita, arguing that lights per person serve as a practical proxy for local per capita income in the absence of uniformly comparable subnational GDP series across the whole study period. The empirical strategy leverages the quasi-random assignment of colonial institutions across districts, conditional on geographic and pre-colonial characteristics, to estimate the causal effect of direct versus indirect rule on long-run development outcomes. We control for a rich set of district covariates capturing human capital, health, physical infrastructure, and geographic features to ensure that the estimated institutional effects are not confounded by observable differences across districts. The main empirical findings document a large and statistically significant cross-sectional gap in nightlights per capita measured in 1993: districts that were historically under direct British rule exhibit about 39.47 percent less nightlights per capita compared with districts that experienced indirect rule. This magnitude is robust to the inclusion of extensive controls, indicating that the colonial-era institutional exposure is not trivially driven by contemporaneous correlates of development. The paper further exploits panel variation in lights to analyze growth dynamics between 1993 and 2013, finding that directly ruled districts had an average annual growth rate in lights that was 1.84 percentage points lower than that of indirectly ruled districts over this twenty-year window. Convergence behavior also differs: directly ruled districts are estimated to be converging at roughly 2 percent per year, whereas indirectly ruled districts converge faster at about 5.7 percent per year, suggesting that the institutional legacy not only affects levels but also growth trajectories. To unpack mechanisms, the paper examines heterogeneity in land tenure and revenue-extraction institutions imposed during colonial administration. The authors document that directly administered areas were more likely to have landlord-based revenue systems—arrangements that vested landlords with formalized rights to extract rent and collect taxes on behalf of the state. Through mediation analysis and controls for land-tenure proxies, they find that much of the persistent development gap between direct and indirect rule areas can be accounted for by the adverse long-run effects of these landlord-based revenue collection systems on local economic incentives and investment patterns. Landlord systems are hypothesized to have discouraged agricultural investment, concentrated land ownership, and created extractive local elites whose interests were misaligned with broad-based development. The replication dataset and code made available alongside the paper support the mapping of historical institutions to modern districts, the construction of lights-per-capita measures, and the main robustness checks, enhancing transparency and reproducibility. The contribution of this work lies in bridging colonial institutional history with modern remote-sensing measures of economic activity to document persistent subnational disparities and to identify plausible institutional transmission channels. By using nightlights per capita as a spatially comprehensive and fine-grained proxy for income, and by carefully linking historical administrative regimes and land-tenure systems to contemporary outcomes, the paper adds to the literature on colonial legacies by highlighting how specific revenue and land tenure arrangements instituted under direct colonial rule can generate long-run developmental disadvantage. The findings have important implications for understanding the roots of regional inequality in India and for the broader literature on institutions and development, suggesting that colonial-era policies continue to shape economic outcomes more than seven decades after independence and that land tenure and local governance structures are key channels through which historical institutions persist.;,citation_author=Saumitra Jha;,citation_author=Anand Talathi;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2021.102726;,citation_volume=153;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Development Economics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Regional inequality, convergence, and its determinants: A view from outer space;,citation_abstract=This paper develops a novel dataset of regional income inequalities that leverages satellite-observed nighttime light intensity to proxy subnational economic activity in a large set of countries, including many developing countries where official subnational income statistics are sparse or inconsistent. The motivation is that understanding regional inequality within countries is critical for policy design, but comprehensive cross-country data on subnational income distributions have been lacking, limiting the ability to study the determinants and dynamics of spatial inequality globally. We address this gap by constructing a lights-based dataset that enables systematic measurement of within-country income dispersion and convergence for a broad sample of countries over time. The methodological approach first estimates the empirical relationship between luminosity and reported regional incomes in the subset of countries where both data are available, using regression models that relate nighttime lights to GDP per capita at the regional level. The fitted luminosity-income mapping is then used to predict regional incomes out-of-sample for countries lacking subnational income series, thereby enabling the computation of standard inequality measures within countries on a uniform basis. The paper emphasizes both cross-sectional prediction—using luminosity to recover spatial income patterns—and dynamic analysis, tracking changes in dispersion and convergence over time using the lights-derived income series. The predicted regional incomes are used to compute commonly used inequality indicators such as variance measures, Theil indices, and other dispersion statistics within country boundaries to trace the evolution of spatial income disparities. The analysis of temporal dynamics finds that a substantial majority of countries exhibit sigma-convergence: approximately 71 to 80 percent of all countries in the sample experienced declining dispersion of regional incomes over the study period, indicating a broad pattern of regional income convergence at the global level. This convergence evidence is complemented by panel regressions and decomposition exercises that probe which factors are associated with within-country inequality changes. A key empirical regularity documented is a nonlinear, N-shaped relationship between the level of overall economic development and regional inequality: at early stages of development regional inequality first rises, then falls, and then rises again at higher levels of average income. This pattern suggests that the interaction between structural transformation, urbanization, and spatial concentration evolves non-monotonically as countries develop, consistent with theories that predict initial divergence as growth takes off in leading regions, followed by convergence as lagging regions catch up, and then renewed divergence at high income levels as agglomeration forces and skill-biased technical change concentrate activity in advanced urban centers. To explain cross-country differences in the level and evolution of regional inequality, the paper examines a broad set of determinants including geography, population mobility, trade openness, and institutional factors. Geography—measured by natural resource endowments and the spatial distribution of cultivable land—affects regional inequality by creating locational advantages and resource rents that can concentrate income. Population mobility and internal migration are found to be important equilibrating forces: more mobile labor is associated with lower regional disparities, as workers move from low-productivity to high-productivity regions, reducing income gaps. Trade openness has ambiguous effects depending on the spatial distribution of comparative advantage, but greater integration with global markets can either concentrate activity in export-oriented regions or spread benefits more widely. The degree of federalism or decentralization is also examined, with results suggesting that institutional arrangements that devolve fiscal and administrative authority can affect regional inequality, though the direction depends on whether decentralization empowers lagging regions or reinforces advantages of leading regions. Human capital and public transfers such as foreign aid are additional correlates: higher human capital is associated with lower regional inequality, possibly because education facilitates mobility and diffusion of knowledge, while aid flows can have heterogeneous effects depending on targeting and governance. In aggregated cross-section and panel specifications, the paper finds that more mobile labor and greater trade openness are associated with lower regional disparities, whereas strong resource dependence and certain institutional arrangements can exacerbate divergence in regional incomes. Methodologically, the paper highlights the practical value of lights-based predictions in enabling systematic measurement of subnational inequality where official data are missing, and it conducts sensitivity checks to ensure that the luminosity-income mapping is empirically credible for the subset of validation countries before applying it more broadly. By combining remote-sensing-derived spatial data with conventional country-level covariates, the study offers a replicable framework for monitoring regional inequality globally and for investigating the economic, geographic, and policy drivers of spatial convergence and divergence. The findings contribute to the regional economics and development literature by providing new stylized facts about the prevalence of regional convergence, by documenting the N-shaped development-inequality relationship, and by identifying key determinants of spatial inequality that can inform policy interventions aimed at promoting balanced regional development.;,citation_author=Christian Lessmann;,citation_author=André Seidel;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2016.11.009;,citation_volume=92;,citation_journal_title=European Economic Review;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lights, camera, income! Illuminating the national accounts-household surveys debate;,citation_abstract=This paper proposes a data-driven measurement model that treats three observed series—national accounts GDP per capita, household survey mean income or consumption, and satellite nighttime lights—as noisy proxies for an unobserved true income per capita process, and uses cross-series dynamics to infer relative signal quality and optimal aggregation weights. The motivation stems from a longstanding debate in development economics about whether national accounts or household surveys provide more accurate measures of income levels and growth in developing countries. National accounts are comprehensive in scope and based on production-side data, but they may suffer from measurement error, incomplete coverage of informal activity, and political manipulation. Household surveys are based on direct reports of income or consumption and capture distributional information, but they are subject to sampling error, non-response bias, and systematic underreporting of top incomes. The discrepancy between national accounts and survey means has grown over time in many countries, raising questions about which source to trust for measuring poverty and inequality. The central identification assumption is that measurement error in the satellite nighttime lights series is independent of the measurement errors in both national accounts and survey means. This exogeneity of lights as an auxiliary proxy permits the decomposition of observed covariation into common signal versus series-specific noise, enabling the estimation of relative signal-to-noise ratios for national accounts and surveys. The authors emphasize robustness checks that support this independence assumption and the stability of results under alternative specifications, including tests for whether lights are correlated with known sources of measurement error in accounts or surveys. Methodologically, the paper contributes by operationalizing an optimal weighting scheme: using the lights series as an external, independent indicator, the authors estimate weights on national accounts and survey means that minimize mean squared error in recovering the latent true income series. The resulting estimator effectively performs a variance-weighted combination of the two traditional indicators where the weight reflects their relative signal-to-noise ratios as implied by co-movement with lights. The estimation uses panel data on GDP per capita from national accounts, mean income or consumption from household surveys, and nighttime lights aggregated to the country level for a large sample of developing countries over several decades. The key empirical result is that the estimated optimal weight on the national accounts series is substantially larger than the weight on surveys; in many specifications the optimal survey weight is statistically indistinguishable from zero, and the hypothesis that surveys should receive higher weight than national accounts is decisively rejected. This finding suggests that national accounts contain more signal about true income than household surveys do, at least for the purpose of measuring aggregate income levels and growth. The paper translates these methodological findings into substantive welfare estimates by constructing an estimated true income per capita series using the optimally weighted proxy and using it to recompute extreme poverty rates at the one-dollar-per-day benchmark. Using the lights-anchored weights yields poverty levels and decline rates that are materially lower and faster respectively than canonical survey-based series such as those reported by Chen and Ravallion, with the implication that growth in poorer countries has been undermeasured by surveys and that the world income distribution has compressed more rapidly than survey evidence alone indicates. The authors also demonstrate external validity by showing that national accounts measures correlate better with several desirable outcomes for the poor—for example, life expectancy, educational attainment, infant mortality, and access to safe water and sanitation—while survey performance degrades in developing countries that are relatively richer and growing faster, consistent with surveys increasingly missing top incomes and informal activity as economies develop. Technical contributions highlighted include the use of an external, independent remote-sensing proxy to identify relative measurement error structure; the implementation of an optimal linear combination rule grounded in observed co-movements with lights; explicit hypothesis testing about relative weights on data sources; and the re-derivation of poverty and distributional statistics from the lights-adjusted income estimates. These elements form a replicable framework for using alternative big-data proxies to adjudicate between traditional national-level and survey-based welfare measures and to produce adjusted welfare series with clear identification assumptions that can be empirically tested. The findings have important implications for the measurement of global poverty and inequality, for the evaluation of development progress toward goals such as the Millennium Development Goals, and for the design of policies that rely on accurate income and poverty statistics. The paper contributes to the broader literature on measurement in economics by demonstrating how auxiliary data sources such as satellite imagery can be used to improve inference about key economic aggregates and to resolve debates about data quality.;,citation_author=Maxim Pinkovskiy;,citation_author=Xavier Sala-i-Martin;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1093/qje/qjw003;,citation_volume=131;,citation_journal_title=Quarterly Journal of Economics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Deblurring DMSP nighttime lights: A new method using gaussian filters and frequencies of illumination;,citation_abstract=Nighttime light observations from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) are widely used to study economic, urban, and demographic phenomena, but they are affected by an overglow or blooming artifact that spatially blurs light sources and systematically spreads observed radiance beyond the true emitting areas. This blooming effect reduces the spatial precision of DMSP nighttime lights data and introduces bias in socioeconomic inference, particularly when analyzing small geographic units or attempting to distinguish between urban cores and peripheries. The objective of this study is to characterize the blurring process, infer a point-spread function (PSF) model conditioned on source brightness and other covariates, and to apply a deconvolution method to recover sharper lights maps that yield improved socioeconomic prediction and spatial accuracy. We use DMSP nightly composites and stable lights products covering global observations over multiple years, and we leverage the temporal frequency of illumination—how often a pixel is lit relative to its neighbors—as a key diagnostic to separate persistent light sources from areas that are lit due to overglow from nearby sources. The empirical insight is that the blur behaves approximately like a symmetric Gaussian point-spread function whose width (standard deviation) increases with the intensity of the source, meaning that brighter sources produce more extensive halos of spurious light in surrounding pixels. We model the satellite image formation process as a convolution of the true underlying light distribution with this intensity-dependent Gaussian PSF, plus additive noise. The modeling approach estimates the PSF by fitting symmetric Gaussian kernels whose parameters vary with measured brightness, and we calibrate kernel parameters separately by satellite platform, year, and geographic region to account for sensor-specific characteristics and temporal changes in sensor performance. The calibration uses empirical relationships between pixel brightness, temporal frequency of detection, and spatial patterns of light spread, estimated from global data. We then apply Richardson-Lucy iterative deconvolution using the empirically derived PSF to reverse the blurring process and recover estimates of the true underlying light distribution. The Richardson-Lucy algorithm is a standard iterative method for image deconvolution that is well-suited to Poisson-distributed data such as photon counts, and we adapt it to handle the Gaussian PSF and to incorporate regularization or stopping criteria to control noise amplification that can occur with iterative deconvolution. Implementation details include procedures for masking transient lights such as fires and auroras, handling saturated pixels in bright urban cores where the sensor reaches its detection limit, and stabilizing deconvolution via spatial priors or total-variation constraints that penalize unrealistic spatial patterns. We validate the deblurring method using the newer VIIRS nighttime light product as a higher-quality benchmark: VIIRS has finer spatial resolution, better radiometric calibration, and less blooming than DMSP, making it a suitable reference for assessing whether deblurred DMSP images more closely resemble the true spatial distribution of lights. Validation comparisons include spatial patterns, point-source widths measured by full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), and pixel-level radiance distributions before and after deconvolution. We also conduct economic validation by using both raw and deblurred DMSP lights to predict external socioeconomic variables such as subnational GDP, population density, and nighttime electricity consumption, and we quantify improvements in predictive fit (R-squared and RMSE) when using deblurred lights. The main results indicate that deblurring substantially reduces the spatial extent of light sources: FWHM around canonical point sources decreases by 30 to 50 percent after deconvolution, bringing DMSP closer to VIIRS in spatial sharpness. Economic prediction models show improvements in correlation and R-squared when using deblurred lights, with reductions in prediction error of 10 to 20 percent for subnational GDP and population, indicating that deblurred maps increase the spatial accuracy of lights as a proxy for economic activity and reduce upward bias in measures for neighboring areas that receive spurious overglow. Qualitative map comparisons show that deblurred DMSP images exhibit sharper urban boundaries, reduced halos around cities, and better separation of distinct light sources, all of which enhance the utility of DMSP data for fine-scale spatial analysis. Limitations include residual noise amplification in low-light regions where the signal-to-noise ratio is poor, uncertainty in PSF estimation in areas with sparse or irregular light sources, and sensitivity to calibration choices across satellites and years, which can affect the consistency of deblurred time series. Robustness checks explore alternative PSF parameterizations, different numbers of Richardson-Lucy iterations, and the impact of masking and regularization choices, finding that the main conclusions are robust but that careful tuning is needed to balance sharpness gains against noise amplification. The contribution of this work is an empirically calibrated Gaussian PSF model for DMSP nighttime lights bloom and a practical Richardson-Lucy deconvolution pipeline that produces spatially sharper lights with demonstrable improvements for remote-sensing applications and economic inference. The deblurring method is applicable to historical DMSP data, enabling researchers to construct more accurate time series of subnational economic activity and to better exploit the spatial information in nighttime lights for urban studies, poverty mapping, and policy evaluation. The paper provides code and parameter estimates to facilitate replication and application of the deblurring method by other researchers.;,citation_author=Alexei Abrahams;,citation_author=Christopher Oram;,citation_author=Nancy Lozano-Gracia;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.rse.2018.03.018;,citation_volume=210;,citation_journal_title=Remote Sensing of Environment;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using luminosity data as a proxy for economic statistics;,citation_abstract=This paper investigates the use of satellite-observed nighttime luminosity as a proxy for economic output and other socioeconomic variables, with a focus on assessing the information content of lights data relative to official statistics and on quantifying the conditions under which lights provide the most value. The motivation is that many low- and middle-income countries lack timely, reliable national accounts and census information, which hampers economic monitoring, policy evaluation, and research. Nighttime luminosity offers an objective, satellite-derived indicator with global coverage and frequent updates that has potential to proxy economic output where administrative data are poor or unavailable. The research question is whether and when nighttime lights contain useful information about economic activity beyond what is available from official GDP statistics, and how that information content varies across countries and contexts. The data consist of nighttime light intensity from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) stable lights product, covering the period 1992 to 2008, and official GDP data from national accounts for a large cross-section of countries. The lights data are aggregated to national and subnational levels, and the analysis also uses a gridded dataset at one-degree resolution to examine spatial patterns within countries. Preprocessing steps include inter-calibration of lights across satellite years to ensure temporal consistency, and masking of ephemeral lights such as fires and gas flares to focus on persistent illumination associated with human settlement and economic activity. The empirical approach uses regression frameworks to relate luminosity to GDP outcomes at country and grid-cell levels, including log-log specifications that estimate the elasticity of GDP with respect to lights, and linear models that assess the share of GDP variation explained by lights. The analysis distinguishes between countries with high versus low statistical quality, using indicators such as the frequency of national accounts revisions, the recency of population censuses, and governance measures, to test whether lights provide more information where official statistics are weaker. Out-of-sample prediction exercises assess the accuracy of GDP estimates based on lights alone versus official statistics, and the paper explores how the information content of lights varies with country characteristics such as income level, urbanization, and sectoral composition. The main findings indicate that nighttime lights are strongly correlated with GDP at both national and subnational levels, with elasticities typically in the range of 0.3 to 0.7, meaning that a one percent increase in lights is associated with a 0.3 to 0.7 percent increase in GDP. The predictive R-squared for cross-sectional regressions of GDP on lights ranges from 0.6 to 0.8 at the country level, indicating that lights explain a substantial share of cross-country income variation. Importantly, the information content of lights is highest in countries with poor statistical quality: in countries with infrequent censuses, high rates of national accounts revisions, or weak governance, lights-based GDP estimates have lower prediction errors than official statistics, and combining lights with official data significantly improves accuracy. In contrast, for countries with strong statistical systems, official GDP dominates and lights add little marginal information. At the subnational level, lights perform well in predicting grid-cell-level economic activity, enabling the construction of spatially disaggregated income estimates that are not available from official sources. The paper also finds that lights are less informative for purely agricultural economies where much economic activity occurs during daylight and does not generate nighttime illumination, and that saturation in dense urban centers can limit the ability of DMSP lights to capture variation in very high-income areas. Robustness checks include alternative lights aggregation methods (sum versus mean radiance), treatment of saturated pixels, inclusion of control variables such as population and urbanization rates, and tests for measurement error bias in official GDP series. The results are robust to these variations, though the magnitude of the lights-GDP relationship varies somewhat with specification choices. The contribution of this paper is to establish nighttime lights as a credible economic proxy at both national and subnational scales, to quantify the conditions under which lights provide the most value—specifically in data-scarce settings with weak official statistics—and to demonstrate practical applications such as constructing historical GDP series, conducting rapid post-disaster assessments, and enabling cross-country comparisons when official data are missing or inconsistent. Limitations include the weaker signal of lights for agricultural economies, saturation issues in dense urban areas, and potential nonstationarity over time as lighting technologies change (for example, the shift from incandescent to LED lighting may alter the lights-GDP relationship). Future work should explore methods to adjust for these limitations and to integrate lights with other remote sensing data to improve coverage of non-luminous economic activity. The findings have important implications for development economics, economic geography, and policy evaluation, suggesting that satellite-derived indicators can complement and in some cases substitute for traditional statistics, and that investments in remote sensing infrastructure and methods can enhance economic measurement and monitoring globally.;,citation_author=Xi Chen;,citation_author=William D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The view from above: Applications of satellite data in economics;,citation_abstract=This paper provides a comprehensive synthesis that introduces economists to the new era of satellite-derived data and computational tools, documenting the revolution in remote sensing, the explosion of data volumes, algorithmic advances in data extraction, and the growing range of economic applications. The past decade has seen a dramatic expansion in the quantity, accessibility, and resolution of satellite imagery, enabling novel economic measurement and causal inference at scales previously impossible. Satellite data now provide economists with rich information about economic activity, infrastructure, environmental conditions, and human behavior that complements traditional data sources and in many cases offers advantages in terms of spatial and temporal coverage, consistency, and timeliness. The data revolution is characterized by the availability of petabytes of publicly accessible imagery across multiple sensors and spectral bands, with trends toward higher spatial resolution (sub-meter pixels), finer spectral resolution (hyperspectral sensors), and more frequent revisit times (daily or sub-daily coverage). These expanded archives allow researchers to observe human activity patterns directly from above, including urbanization, agricultural production, deforestation, infrastructure development, and even proxies for economic output such as nighttime lights. The diversity of sensors includes optical imagery in visible and infrared bands, radar that penetrates clouds, thermal sensors, and specialized instruments for measuring vegetation, water, and atmospheric conditions. Algorithmic and computational advances have made it routine to process and analyze these massive datasets: automated classification algorithms can identify land cover types, detect objects such as buildings and vehicles, track time-series changes such as crop growth or urban expansion, and derive economic proxies such as nighttime lights intensity, vegetation indices (NDVI), and measures of agricultural productivity (net primary production). Cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine and commercial services provide parallel processing capabilities that make global-scale analysis tractable for researchers without specialized infrastructure. The paper provides a taxonomy of how economists have used satellite data, organized into several categories: (a) proxies for economic activity, where nighttime lights are used to estimate GDP, income, or consumption at subnational scales where official data are unavailable; (b) indicators of infrastructure and capital stocks, such as roads, buildings, and electrification, which can be measured directly from high-resolution imagery and used to study the impacts of infrastructure investments; (c) environmental covariates, including vegetation indices, land cover, temperature, and precipitation, which are inputs to agricultural production functions and determinants of health and productivity; and (d) event detection for causal inference, where satellite data identify shocks such as natural disasters, conflicts, or policy changes that provide quasi-experimental variation for estimating causal effects. Typical empirical designs include panel analyses that exploit time-series variation in satellite-derived measures, difference-in-differences strategies that compare treated and control areas before and after events, and machine-learning prediction models that use satellite features to impute missing official statistics. Methodological themes and best practices are discussed, including the importance of validation against ground truth data to assess the accuracy of satellite-derived measures, dealing with sensor-specific biases and calibration issues such as inter-sensor harmonization when combining data from different satellites, understanding measurement error implications for econometric inference (for example, classical measurement error in dependent variables does not bias coefficients but reduces precision, while measurement error in independent variables can cause attenuation bias), and making appropriate aggregation choices when converting pixel-level data to administrative units or other geographic partitions. The paper emphasizes computational pipelines and reproducibility practices, noting that the complexity of satellite data processing requires careful documentation and sharing of code to ensure that results can be replicated and extended. Future possibilities and open problems are outlined, including the integration of multi-sensor data fusion to combine complementary information from optical, radar, and other sources; the development of high-frequency economic indicators that leverage daily or sub-daily satellite observations for real-time monitoring; improving measurement of rural and informal economic activity that is not well captured by nighttime lights or other existing proxies; and embedding remote sensing in randomized evaluations to measure treatment effects at fine spatial and temporal scales. Challenges include privacy concerns as higher-resolution imagery makes it possible to identify individuals and private property, representativeness limits because satellite data may not capture all forms of economic activity (for example, indoor manufacturing or services), and the need for better uncertainty quantification to understand the precision of satellite-derived estimates and to conduct valid statistical inference. The paper emphasizes its role as an introduction that both surveys current applications and sets an agenda for future research leveraging satellite data in economics. It provides practical guidance for economists interested in using satellite data, including pointers to publicly available datasets, software tools, and tutorials, and it discusses the skills and interdisciplinary collaborations needed to effectively work with remote sensing data. The contribution is to synthesize a rapidly growing literature, to highlight the opportunities and challenges of satellite data for economic research, and to encourage broader adoption of these tools by demonstrating their value for addressing important economic questions. The findings suggest that satellite data are becoming an essential part of the economist’s toolkit, particularly for research on development, environmental economics, urban economics, and any application where spatial and temporal granularity is important. The paper concludes by noting that as satellite technology continues to advance and as computational tools become more accessible, the scope for satellite-based economic research will expand, offering new opportunities to measure economic phenomena, test theories, and inform policy in ways that were not possible with traditional data sources alone.;,citation_author=Dave Donaldson;,citation_author=Adam Storeygard;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1257/jep.30.4.171;,citation_volume=30;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Economic Perspectives;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=VIIRS night-time lights;,citation_abstract=This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) nighttime lights data product, describing the sensor characteristics, data processing methods, product generation, and applications for economic and social science research. VIIRS represents a major advance over the previous Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime lights data, offering improved spatial resolution, radiometric calibration, and dynamic range that address many of the limitations of DMSP data. The VIIRS DNB sensor was launched aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) satellite in 2011 and has been operational since 2012, providing global nighttime lights observations with unprecedented quality and consistency. The motivation for developing VIIRS nighttime lights stems from the recognition that DMSP-OLS data, while pioneering and widely used, suffered from several technical limitations including coarse spatial resolution (approximately 2.7 kilometers at nadir), lack of on-board calibration leading to inconsistent radiometry across sensors and over time, saturation in bright urban cores where the sensor reached its detection limit, and blooming or overglow effects that spread light from bright sources into surrounding pixels. These limitations constrained the ability to detect fine-scale spatial patterns, to accurately measure changes in brightness over time, and to distinguish between different levels of illumination in densely lit areas. VIIRS addresses these limitations through several key improvements: finer spatial resolution of approximately 750 meters at nadir, enabling detection of smaller light sources and better delineation of urban boundaries; on-board radiometric calibration that provides consistent, quantitative measurements of radiance in units of nanoWatts per square centimeter per steradian, allowing for accurate time-series analysis and cross-sensor comparisons; a much wider dynamic range that avoids saturation in bright areas and can detect very dim lights, capturing the full spectrum of illumination from rural villages to dense urban centers; and reduced blooming through improved sensor design and data processing, resulting in sharper spatial patterns. The data processing pipeline for VIIRS nighttime lights involves several steps: raw DNB data are collected during nighttime overpasses and undergo radiometric calibration using on-board calibration sources; stray light correction algorithms remove contamination from moonlight, airglow, and other sources; cloud detection and masking are applied to exclude cloudy pixels; and temporal compositing aggregates multiple overpasses to produce monthly or annual composite products that average out transient lights such as fires, boats, and auroras while preserving persistent illumination from human settlements. The standard VIIRS DNB product is a monthly cloud-free composite that provides average radiance values for each pixel, along with metadata on the number of observations and quality flags. Annual composites are also produced by averaging monthly composites, and these annual products are commonly used for economic and social science applications. Product generation includes additional processing steps such as outlier removal to exclude anomalous observations, background subtraction to remove natural airglow and other non-anthropogenic light sources, and optional filtering to exclude specific features such as gas flares or fishing boats depending on the application. The resulting VIIRS nighttime lights products are distributed freely through the Earth Observation Group at NOAA and through NASA’s data portals, making them accessible to researchers worldwide. Applications of VIIRS nighttime lights in economic and social science research are diverse and growing: the data are used to estimate GDP and economic growth at subnational scales, to map poverty and inequality, to monitor urbanization and infrastructure development, to assess the impacts of conflicts and natural disasters, to track electrification and energy access, and to study a wide range of socioeconomic phenomena where traditional data are lacking. The improved spatial resolution and radiometric quality of VIIRS enable more accurate and detailed analyses than were possible with DMSP, and the consistent calibration facilitates time-series studies that track changes in economic activity over time. Validation studies have shown that VIIRS nighttime lights correlate strongly with economic indicators such as GDP, electricity consumption, and population density, with correlations often exceeding 0.8 at subnational scales, and that VIIRS outperforms DMSP in predictive accuracy and spatial precision. Methodological considerations for using VIIRS data include the need to account for differences in sensor characteristics when combining VIIRS with historical DMSP data, the importance of appropriate spatial aggregation to match the scale of economic or administrative units, and the recognition that nighttime lights are an imperfect proxy that may not capture all forms of economic activity, particularly in rural or agricultural areas where much activity occurs during daylight. The paper also discusses ongoing improvements to VIIRS data products, including enhanced stray light correction, better cloud masking, and the development of higher-level products such as annual time series and change detection layers. Future directions include the integration of VIIRS data with other satellite sensors and ground-based data to create multi-source datasets that provide more comprehensive measures of economic activity, the development of machine learning methods to extract additional information from VIIRS imagery, and the expansion of applications to new domains such as public health, environmental monitoring, and climate change research. The contribution of this paper is to provide a detailed technical reference for researchers using VIIRS nighttime lights, to document the improvements over DMSP and the implications for empirical research, and to highlight best practices and methodological considerations for working with VIIRS data. The findings underscore the value of VIIRS as a next-generation nighttime lights product that enables more accurate, detailed, and consistent measurement of human activity from space, and the paper serves as a foundational resource for the growing community of economists and social scientists using satellite nighttime lights data in their research.;,citation_author=Christopher D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Which night lights data should we use in economics, and where?;,citation_abstract=This paper provides a systematic comparison of different nighttime lights datasets—DMSP-OLS, VIIRS, and harmonized products—to guide researchers on which data source to use for economic applications and to document how the choice of lights data affects empirical results. The motivation is that multiple nighttime lights products are now available, each with different sensor characteristics, processing methods, and temporal coverage, and researchers face decisions about which product to use for their specific application. These choices matter because different lights datasets can yield different empirical conclusions about economic growth, poverty, and inequality, yet there is limited guidance in the literature on the relative strengths and weaknesses of each product and on how to make informed choices. The paper addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of lights data quality, predictive performance, and sensitivity of empirical results across different datasets and geographic contexts. The datasets examined include the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) stable lights annual composites covering 1992 to 2013, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band (VIIRS) monthly and annual composites available from 2012 onward, and harmonized products that attempt to create consistent time series by combining or calibrating DMSP and VIIRS data, such as the inter-calibrated DMSP series and the DMSP-VIIRS harmonization by Li et al. The evaluation uses ground-truth economic data from household surveys, national accounts, and administrative sources for a diverse set of countries and subnational regions, allowing assessment of how well each lights product predicts income, consumption, poverty rates, and economic growth. The empirical approach includes cross-sectional regressions of economic outcomes on lights at national and subnational levels, time-series growth regressions, and out-of-sample prediction exercises that test the accuracy of lights-based estimates. The analysis also examines how the lights-income relationship varies across countries with different income levels, urbanization rates, and statistical capacity, and how it varies within countries across urban and rural areas. Key dimensions of comparison include spatial resolution and the ability to detect fine-scale economic variation, radiometric accuracy and the consistency of brightness measurements over time and across sensors, dynamic range and the ability to measure both very dim and very bright lights without saturation, and temporal coverage and the availability of long time series for panel analyses. The main findings indicate that VIIRS outperforms DMSP in most dimensions: VIIRS has finer spatial resolution that better captures subnational variation, superior radiometric calibration that provides more accurate and consistent brightness measurements, and a wider dynamic range that avoids saturation in urban areas and detects dim lights in rural areas. In cross-sectional regressions, VIIRS explains a higher share of variation in subnational income and consumption than DMSP, with R-squared values typically 10 to 20 percentage points higher. VIIRS also performs better in out-of-sample prediction, with lower root mean squared errors for GDP and poverty estimates. However, DMSP has the advantage of longer temporal coverage, spanning 1992 to 2013, which is valuable for long-run growth studies and for analyzing historical trends before VIIRS became available. The paper finds that harmonized products that attempt to combine DMSP and VIIRS offer a compromise, extending the time series while incorporating some of the quality improvements of VIIRS, but the harmonization process introduces additional uncertainty and the resulting series may not fully capture the benefits of either source. The analysis also reveals important geographic heterogeneity in the performance of lights data: in high-income and highly urbanized countries, DMSP suffers from saturation and VIIRS provides much better measurement, whereas in low-income and rural areas, both DMSP and VIIRS have weaker correlations with economic outcomes because much economic activity is agricultural and does not generate nighttime illumination. The paper documents cases where the choice of lights data affects substantive conclusions: for example, estimated growth rates can differ by one to two percentage points per year depending on whether DMSP or VIIRS is used, and poverty trends can show different patterns when estimated with different lights products. These differences are particularly pronounced in rapidly growing or urbanizing regions where DMSP saturation is severe. Methodological recommendations based on the findings include the following: for cross-sectional studies and recent time periods (2012 onward), VIIRS is preferred due to its superior spatial and radiometric quality; for long-run time-series studies that require data before 2012, DMSP is necessary but researchers should be aware of its limitations and consider using inter-calibrated versions to improve temporal consistency; for studies spanning the DMSP-VIIRS transition period, harmonized products can be used but with caution and sensitivity checks to ensure that results are not driven by harmonization artifacts; and for all applications, researchers should validate lights-based measures against available ground-truth data and conduct robustness checks using alternative lights products to assess the sensitivity of their conclusions. The paper also emphasizes the importance of context-specific evaluation: the relative performance of lights data varies across countries and regions, so researchers should assess data quality for their specific study area rather than relying on global averages. The contribution of this work is to provide practical, evidence-based guidance for researchers using nighttime lights in economic applications, to document the trade-offs between different lights products, and to highlight the sensitivity of empirical results to data choices. The findings underscore the need for careful data selection and robustness checks when using nighttime lights, and they provide a framework for evaluating and comparing lights datasets that can be applied to future products as satellite technology continues to evolve.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A bright idea for measuring economic growth;,citation_abstract=This paper introduces the use of satellite nighttime lights data as a tool for measuring economic growth, particularly in countries where official GDP statistics are unreliable, and provides initial evidence on the information content of lights relative to official national accounts. The motivation is straightforward: many developing countries have weak statistical systems that produce GDP estimates with substantial measurement error, long publication lags, and frequent revisions, which hampers timely policy responses and economic research. Satellite-observed nighttime lights offer an alternative, objective measure of economic activity that is available globally, updated frequently, and not subject to the political and institutional factors that can distort official statistics. The key insight is that nighttime illumination is strongly correlated with economic activity because electricity consumption and outdoor lighting are inputs to production and consumption, and because the spatial distribution of lights reflects the geographic concentration of economic activity in cities, towns, and industrial areas. The paper proposes using lights data to improve measurement of economic growth by combining lights-based growth estimates with official GDP growth in an optimal way that accounts for the measurement error in each source. The data come from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS), which has collected nighttime lights observations since the early 1990s. The DMSP-OLS sensors detect visible and near-infrared light at night, capturing illumination from street lights, buildings, vehicles, and other human sources. The data are processed into annual stable lights composites that filter out transient lights such as fires and fishing boats, and the resulting images provide a consistent measure of persistent nighttime illumination at approximately 1-kilometer spatial resolution. The empirical approach estimates the relationship between lights growth and GDP growth using data from countries with relatively reliable national accounts, and then uses this relationship to infer the measurement error properties of official GDP statistics. The key assumption is that lights provide an independent signal of true economic growth that is uncorrelated with the measurement error in official GDP, allowing the authors to decompose observed GDP growth into a true component and a noise component. The estimation uses a simple regression framework where observed GDP growth is regressed on lights growth, and the coefficient on lights growth provides information about the relative signal-to-noise ratios of the two measures. The main findings indicate that lights growth is a strong predictor of GDP growth, with elasticities typically around 0.3 to 0.4, meaning that a one percent increase in lights is associated with a 0.3 to 0.4 percent increase in GDP. The correlation between lights growth and GDP growth is higher in countries with weaker statistical systems, suggesting that lights provide more information where official statistics are less reliable. The paper estimates that for countries with the weakest statistical capacity, the optimal weight on lights-based growth estimates is substantial, often 30 to 50 percent, indicating that combining lights with official GDP can significantly improve growth measurement. The authors also show that lights-based growth estimates are less volatile than official GDP growth, which is consistent with the idea that official statistics contain substantial transitory measurement error that lights help to filter out. The paper discusses several practical applications of lights-based growth measurement: constructing more accurate historical GDP series for countries with poor data, providing real-time growth estimates when official statistics are delayed, and enabling subnational growth measurement at the state or district level where official GDP data are not available. The findings also have implications for cross-country growth regressions and convergence studies, suggesting that measurement error in GDP can bias estimated convergence rates and that using lights to adjust for this error can improve inference. Limitations of lights as a growth measure are acknowledged: lights are less informative for agricultural economies where much activity occurs during daylight, lights may not capture productivity improvements that do not increase electricity consumption, and changes in lighting technology (such as the shift to more efficient LED lighting) could alter the lights-GDP relationship over time. Despite these limitations, the paper argues that lights provide valuable complementary information that can improve economic measurement, particularly in data-scarce environments. The contribution is to introduce nighttime lights as a practical tool for measuring economic growth, to provide a simple framework for combining lights with official statistics, and to demonstrate the potential value of satellite data for addressing measurement challenges in development economics. The paper has been highly influential in spurring subsequent research on nighttime lights and economic measurement, and it has established lights data as a standard tool in the economist’s toolkit for studying growth, poverty, and development at subnational scales.;,citation_author=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A test of the new VIIRS lights data set: Population and economic output in africa;,citation_abstract=This paper provides an early evaluation of the new VIIRS nighttime lights data by testing its performance in predicting population and economic output in Africa, comparing VIIRS to the older DMSP-OLS lights data, and assessing whether the improvements in sensor technology translate into better economic measurement. The motivation is that VIIRS represents a major technological advance over DMSP with finer spatial resolution, radiometric calibration, and wider dynamic range, but it is important to empirically verify whether these technical improvements actually enhance the ability to measure socioeconomic variables. Africa is chosen as the test region because it has substantial variation in income levels, urbanization, and data quality, and because many African countries have weak statistical systems where improved measurement tools are most needed. The data include VIIRS DNB monthly composites for 2012 and 2013, DMSP-OLS stable lights for the same period, population data from census and gridded population datasets, and GDP estimates at national and subnational levels from national accounts and other sources. The empirical approach estimates cross-sectional regressions of population and GDP on lights at multiple spatial scales—national, first-level administrative divisions (states or provinces), and grid cells—and compares the predictive performance of VIIRS versus DMSP using metrics such as R-squared, root mean squared error, and out-of-sample prediction accuracy. The analysis also examines how the lights-population and lights-GDP relationships vary across urban and rural areas, and whether VIIRS provides better measurement in densely populated or high-income areas where DMSP suffers from saturation. The main findings indicate that VIIRS outperforms DMSP in predicting both population and GDP in Africa: VIIRS explains a higher share of variation in population and GDP at all spatial scales, with R-squared values typically 10 to 15 percentage points higher than DMSP. For example, in cross-sectional regressions of log GDP on log lights at the first administrative level, VIIRS achieves R-squared around 0.75 compared to 0.60 for DMSP, indicating a substantial improvement in explanatory power. Out-of-sample prediction errors are also lower for VIIRS, with RMSE reductions of 15 to 25 percent for GDP predictions. The improvements are most pronounced in urban and high-income areas where DMSP saturation is severe: VIIRS captures variation in brightness across cities and wealthy regions that DMSP cannot detect due to its limited dynamic range, allowing for more accurate differentiation of economic activity levels. In rural and low-income areas, both VIIRS and DMSP have weaker correlations with economic outcomes, reflecting the fact that much rural economic activity is agricultural and does not generate significant nighttime illumination, but VIIRS still performs somewhat better due to its ability to detect dim lights from small settlements and rural electrification. The paper also finds that VIIRS provides more spatially detailed information: the finer resolution of VIIRS (750 meters versus 2.7 kilometers for DMSP) allows for better delineation of urban boundaries, identification of smaller towns and villages, and more accurate spatial allocation of population and economic activity to grid cells or administrative units. This spatial precision is valuable for subnational analysis and for applications such as poverty mapping and infrastructure planning that require fine-scale geographic detail. The analysis includes robustness checks such as alternative functional forms (log-log versus linear), different spatial aggregations (national versus subnational versus grid cells), and controls for population density and urbanization, and the main conclusions are robust across specifications. The paper also discusses practical considerations for using VIIRS data, including the need to account for differences in sensor characteristics when combining VIIRS with historical DMSP data, the importance of appropriate cloud masking and outlier removal in VIIRS processing, and the recognition that VIIRS monthly composites can be more volatile than DMSP annual composites due to the shorter averaging period, which may require temporal smoothing for some applications. The contribution of this work is to provide early empirical evidence that VIIRS nighttime lights offer substantial improvements over DMSP for measuring population and economic output, particularly in urban and high-income areas, and to validate the use of VIIRS for economic research in Africa and other developing regions. The findings support the adoption of VIIRS as the preferred nighttime lights product for cross-sectional and recent time-series studies, while acknowledging that DMSP remains necessary for long-run historical analyses. The paper serves as a foundational reference for researchers transitioning from DMSP to VIIRS data and contributes to the broader literature on satellite-based economic measurement by demonstrating the value of improved sensor technology for enhancing data quality and empirical inference.;,citation_author=Xi Chen;,citation_author=William D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A python notebook for processing nighttime lights data: Methods and applications;,citation_abstract=This computational notebook provides a comprehensive, user-friendly, and reproducible workflow for processing satellite nighttime lights (NTL) data and applying it to regional economic analysis, with a focus on accessibility for researchers who may not have extensive remote sensing or programming expertise. The motivation is that while nighttime lights have become a standard tool in development economics and regional science, the technical barriers to accessing, processing, and analyzing NTL data remain substantial for many researchers. Existing tools often require specialized software, significant computational resources, or deep knowledge of remote sensing methods, which limits the adoption of NTL data in empirical research. This notebook addresses these barriers by providing a cloud-based, open-source Python environment that integrates data ingestion, preprocessing, spatial analysis, visualization, and economic modeling in a single, documented, and executable workflow. The notebook is designed to run in cloud-based platforms such as Google Colab or Binder, eliminating the need for local software installation or high-performance computing infrastructure, and it uses widely adopted Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, GeoPandas, Rasterio, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to ensure compatibility and ease of use. The core processing pipeline includes several modular components that can be executed sequentially or adapted for specific research needs. Data ingestion routines provide automated methods to fetch global nightly or annual composite products from public repositories such as NOAA’s Earth Observation Group for DMSP-OLS and VIIRS data, along with ancillary datasets including administrative boundary shapefiles, population grids, and other geospatial layers. The notebook includes functions to handle different data formats (GeoTIFF, HDF, NetCDF), to subset global datasets to specific regions of interest, and to manage metadata and coordinate reference systems. Preprocessing steps address common data quality issues and prepare NTL data for analysis: noise filtering removes transient lights from fires, auroras, and other non-persistent sources using temporal frequency thresholds and spatial filters; cloud and stray light mitigation applies masking and correction algorithms to exclude cloudy pixels and reduce contamination from moonlight and airglow; inter-sensor harmonization implements scaling and calibration methods to create consistent time series when combining DMSP and VIIRS data, including the application of published inter-calibration coefficients and regression-based adjustments; and optional corrections for overglow and blooming artifacts use deconvolution or empirical adjustment methods to reduce spatial blurring in DMSP data. Raster-to-tabular transformation is a critical step that converts pixel-level radiance data into unit-level aggregates suitable for econometric analysis: the notebook provides spatial join functions that overlay administrative boundaries or custom polygons onto NTL rasters and compute zonal statistics (sum, mean, median, standard deviation) for each spatial unit, producing panel datasets with per-unit time series of nighttime lights ready for regression analysis. The transformation handles edge cases such as units with zero lights, partial pixel coverage, and missing data, and it includes options for population-weighting and area-weighting to account for differences in unit size and population distribution. Visualization and interactive exploration tools enable researchers to inspect spatial and temporal patterns in the data: the notebook generates static maps of NTL intensity at different time points, animated time-series maps that show the evolution of lights over years or decades, and interactive linked plots that allow users to click on map features and view corresponding time series or summary statistics. These visualizations help identify data anomalies, spatial clusters, and trends that inform subsequent modeling choices. The notebook also provides reproducible modeling and validation recipes for common empirical tasks in regional economics. For cross-sectional income prediction, it implements simple and multiple regression models that relate official GDP or survey-based income to log or level radiance with population weights, includes diagnostic plots and specification checks for linearity and heteroskedasticity, and produces out-of-sample prediction metrics such as R-squared, RMSE, and mean absolute error. For time-series growth estimation, the notebook includes routines for computing growth rates from radiance data (handling zeros and applying thresholds to exclude noise), for estimating convergence regressions that test whether poorer regions grow faster, and for performing sigma-inequality calculations that measure the dispersion of per-capita lights across spatial units over time. Decomposition tools such as Theil and Gini indices computed from radiance-derived per-capita proxies are provided to analyze within-country and between-region inequality dynamics. Evaluation methods mirror best practices from the literature: the notebook reports correlations and explained variance between predicted and observed GDP where ground-truth data are available, performs region-specific stability tests to assess whether the lights-GDP relationship varies spatially, and includes sensitivity analyses to sensor choices (DMSP versus VIIRS), preprocessing options (filtering thresholds, harmonization methods), and functional forms (log-log versus linear). The notebook also enables benchmarking against survey means where household surveys exist, and provides simple measurement-error perspectives by comparing trends implied by lights, surveys, and national accounts to highlight potential undercounting biases in household surveys. A cloud-based implementation using containerized Python environments (Docker, Binder, or Google Colab) ensures that the notebook is accessible to users without specialized hardware or software, and modular tutorials guide users through progressively complex tasks: (1) basic processing and mapping introduces data loading, subsetting, and visualization; (2) estimation of subnational income and growth demonstrates regression modeling and prediction; (3) inequality decomposition and visualization covers dispersion measures and spatial inequality analysis; and (4) model evaluation and robustness checks teach validation methods and sensitivity testing. Each tutorial includes example datasets, step-by-step instructions, and exercises that users can adapt to their own research questions. The notebook emphasizes reproducibility and transparency: all code is documented with inline comments and markdown explanations, data sources and processing steps are clearly described, and version control via GitHub enables tracking of changes and collaborative development. The notebook also includes references to key papers in the NTL literature, links to data repositories, and suggestions for further reading, making it a comprehensive educational resource as well as a practical tool. The contribution of this work is to lower the barriers to entry for using nighttime lights data in economic research by providing an accessible, well-documented, and reproducible computational workflow that integrates data processing, analysis, and visualization in a single environment. By enabling researchers to quickly process NTL data and apply it to their specific research questions without needing deep remote sensing expertise, the notebook promotes wider adoption of satellite data in economics and contributes to improving the rigor and reproducibility of empirical research. The notebook has been used in workshops and courses to train students and researchers in NTL methods, and it serves as a template that can be extended and customized for diverse applications in development economics, regional science, urban studies, and policy evaluation.;,citation_author=Carlos Mendez;,citation_author=Ayush Patnaik;,citation_publication_date=2024;,citation_cover_date=2024;,citation_year=2024;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://github.com/quarcs-lab/project2022p;,citation_publisher=GitHub Repository;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A harmonized global nighttime light dataset 1992–2018;,citation_abstract=This paper presents a harmonized global nighttime light dataset that integrates Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) data from 1992 to 2013 with Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band (VIIRS-DNB) data from 2012 to 2018, creating a consistent 27-year time series that addresses the discontinuity between the two sensor systems and enables long-run empirical studies of economic growth, urbanization, and development. The motivation stems from the recognition that DMSP and VIIRS data have complementary strengths—DMSP provides long historical coverage essential for studying multi-decade trends, while VIIRS offers superior spatial resolution, radiometric calibration, and dynamic range—but the two datasets are not directly comparable due to differences in sensor characteristics, spatial resolution, radiometric units, and temporal coverage. This incompatibility creates a challenge for researchers who need consistent time series spanning the pre-VIIRS and post-VIIRS eras, and existing approaches to combining the datasets have been ad hoc or limited in scope. The harmonization methodology developed in this paper addresses these challenges through a multi-step process that aligns the spatial, radiometric, and temporal characteristics of DMSP and VIIRS data. The first step is spatial harmonization: VIIRS data, which have native resolution of approximately 500 meters, are resampled to match the coarser 30 arc-second (approximately 1 kilometer) resolution of DMSP using spatial aggregation methods that preserve total radiance while accounting for the point spread function and pixel overlap. This resampling ensures that spatial patterns are comparable across sensors and that subsequent radiometric adjustments are not confounded by resolution differences. The second step is radiometric harmonization, which addresses the fact that DMSP reports digital numbers (DN) without physical units and suffers from saturation in bright areas, while VIIRS reports calibrated radiance in nanoWatts per square centimeter per steradian and has a much wider dynamic range. The authors develop an empirical calibration function that maps VIIRS radiance to DMSP-equivalent DN values using data from the 2012-2013 overlap period when both sensors were operational. The calibration is performed at the pixel level using a power-law or sigmoid transformation that accounts for the nonlinear relationship between DMSP DN and VIIRS radiance, and it includes adjustments for DMSP saturation by capping the simulated DN values at the DMSP saturation threshold (typically DN = 63). The calibration function is estimated separately for different geographic regions and land cover types to account for spatial heterogeneity in the lights-radiance relationship, and validation exercises confirm that the simulated DMSP-like values from VIIRS closely match actual DMSP observations during the overlap period. The third step is temporal inter-calibration of the DMSP time series itself, which is necessary because DMSP data come from multiple satellites with different sensors and calibration characteristics, leading to inconsistencies and artificial jumps in the time series when satellites change. The authors apply established inter-calibration methods that use invariant regions (areas with stable lighting over time) as reference points to adjust DN values across satellites, creating a consistent DMSP series from 1992 to 2013. The final harmonized dataset combines the inter-calibrated DMSP series (1992-2013) with the DMSP-simulated VIIRS series (2014-2018), producing a seamless 27-year time series in DMSP-equivalent units that can be used for long-run panel analyses without structural breaks. The dataset is provided as annual global composites at 30 arc-second resolution in GeoTIFF format, along with metadata, quality flags, and documentation of the harmonization procedures. Validation of the harmonized dataset includes several checks: comparison of trends in the harmonized series against independent economic indicators such as GDP growth and electricity consumption, which show consistent correlations over the full time period; visual inspection of time series for major cities and regions to ensure smooth transitions at the DMSP-VIIRS boundary without artificial jumps; and statistical tests for structural breaks at 2013-2014, which confirm that the harmonization successfully eliminates discontinuities. The authors also compare the harmonized dataset to alternative approaches such as simple rescaling or using only DMSP or only VIIRS, demonstrating that the harmonized series provides better temporal consistency and more accurate long-run growth estimates. Applications of the harmonized dataset are diverse and include studies of long-run economic growth and convergence at subnational scales, analyses of urbanization and spatial expansion of cities over multiple decades, assessments of the impacts of major policy reforms or shocks that occurred before the VIIRS era, and construction of consistent historical series for poverty mapping and inequality measurement. The availability of a harmonized 27-year time series enables researchers to exploit longer panels with more statistical power and to study slow-moving processes such as structural transformation and regional convergence that require multi-decade observations. The paper discusses limitations and caveats: the harmonization necessarily involves approximations and the simulated DMSP-like values from VIIRS do not perfectly replicate actual DMSP observations, particularly in areas with very bright or very dim lights where the calibration function is less accurate; the harmonization inherits the limitations of DMSP data, including saturation and blooming, which are not fully corrected; and changes in lighting technology over time, such as the shift from incandescent to LED lighting, may affect the lights-economic activity relationship in ways that are not accounted for in the harmonization. Despite these limitations, the harmonized dataset represents a substantial improvement over using raw DMSP and VIIRS data separately, and it has been widely adopted in the research community. The contribution of this work is to provide a publicly available, well-documented, and methodologically rigorous harmonized nighttime lights dataset that enables long-run empirical research, to develop and validate harmonization methods that can be applied to future sensor transitions, and to facilitate reproducible research by making the data and processing code openly accessible. The dataset has been downloaded thousands of times and cited in numerous studies, establishing it as a standard resource for economists and social scientists studying long-run development and spatial dynamics using nighttime lights.;,citation_author=Xi Li;,citation_author=Yuyu Zhou;,citation_author=Min Zhao;,citation_author=Xia Zhao;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1038/s41597-020-0510-y;,citation_volume=7;,citation_journal_title=Scientific Data;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=National trends in satellite-observed lighting: 1992–2012;,citation_abstract=This paper documents national trends in satellite-observed nighttime lighting from 1992 to 2012 using inter-calibrated DMSP-OLS data, and it provides a comprehensive methodology for inter-calibration that addresses the inconsistencies across different DMSP satellites to create a consistent time series suitable for studying long-run economic and demographic trends. The motivation is that the DMSP-OLS nighttime lights dataset, while pioneering and widely used, suffers from a critical limitation: data are collected by multiple satellites over time, each with different sensor characteristics, gain settings, and degradation patterns, leading to systematic differences in reported digital numbers (DN) for the same locations across satellites. Without correction, these inter-satellite inconsistencies create artificial jumps and trends in time series that confound genuine changes in lighting and economic activity, making it difficult to study growth, urbanization, and development over multi-year periods. The inter-calibration methodology developed in this paper aims to remove these artificial variations and produce a consistent DMSP time series that reflects true changes in lighting. The approach is based on the concept of invariant regions: geographic areas that are expected to have stable lighting over time and can serve as reference points for calibrating different satellites. The authors identify invariant regions using several criteria: areas with consistent DN values across multiple years within a single satellite’s operational period, areas in countries with stable economic conditions and minimal conflict or natural disasters, and areas that are not undergoing rapid urbanization or electrification. Examples of invariant regions include established urban centers in developed countries, military bases, and certain industrial facilities. The inter-calibration procedure involves several steps: first, for each pair of overlapping satellites (satellites that were operational simultaneously for at least one year), the authors compute the relationship between DN values in invariant regions, typically using a second-order polynomial regression that relates DN from one satellite to DN from another; second, these pairwise calibration functions are chained together to create a consistent reference frame, with one satellite (typically F16 from 2006) chosen as the reference to which all other satellites are adjusted; third, the calibration functions are applied globally to adjust DN values for all pixels and all years, producing an inter-calibrated time series in which DN values are comparable across satellites and years. The authors also address temporal degradation within individual satellites by applying trend corrections that account for sensor aging and drift over a satellite’s operational lifespan. The inter-calibrated dataset covers 1992 to 2012 and includes annual global composites at 30 arc-second resolution, with each pixel’s DN value adjusted to be consistent with the reference satellite. Validation of the inter-calibration includes comparisons of trends in inter-calibrated lights against independent indicators such as national GDP, electricity consumption, and population growth, which show improved correlations and reduced noise compared to raw DMSP data. The paper also presents visual comparisons of time series for selected cities and countries, demonstrating that the inter-calibration eliminates artificial jumps at satellite transition points and produces smoother, more plausible trends. National trends analysis using the inter-calibrated data reveals several stylized facts: global lit area and total radiance increased substantially from 1992 to 2012, with the fastest growth in Asia (particularly China and India) and slower growth or even declines in some developed countries and conflict-affected regions; the spatial distribution of lighting became more concentrated in urban areas, consistent with ongoing urbanization; and there is considerable heterogeneity in lighting trends across countries, reflecting differences in economic growth rates, electrification policies, and development trajectories. The paper provides country-level statistics on changes in lit area, total DN, and mean DN, which serve as proxies for urbanization, economic growth, and electrification. These statistics have been widely used in subsequent research as baseline measures of development trends. Methodological contributions include the development of a replicable inter-calibration protocol that has been adopted as a standard preprocessing step for DMSP data in economic and social science applications, the identification and validation of invariant regions that can be used for calibration, and the documentation of sensor-specific characteristics and degradation patterns that inform data quality assessments. The inter-calibrated DMSP dataset produced by this work has become a foundational resource for long-run studies of economic growth, urbanization, poverty, and inequality using nighttime lights, and it has been incorporated into numerous publicly available data products and analysis tools. Limitations of the inter-calibration are acknowledged: the method assumes that invariant regions are truly stable, which may not hold perfectly in all cases; the polynomial calibration functions are empirical approximations that may not capture all nonlinearities in the sensor response; and the inter-calibration does not address other DMSP limitations such as saturation, blooming, and lack of absolute radiometric calibration. Despite these limitations, the inter-calibrated DMSP data represent a substantial improvement over raw data for time-series analysis, and the methodology has been validated and refined in subsequent work. The contribution of this paper is to provide a rigorous and transparent inter-calibration methodology for DMSP nighttime lights, to produce a consistent 21-year time series that enables credible long-run empirical research, and to document national lighting trends that serve as a baseline for understanding global patterns of development and urbanization.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Introduction to spatial econometrics;,citation_abstract=This book provides a comprehensive introduction to spatial econometric methods, covering both theoretical foundations and practical applications, with emphasis on proper interpretation of spatial models and the computation of direct, indirect, and total effects that correctly account for spatial feedback loops. The motivation for spatial econometrics stems from the recognition that economic and social phenomena often exhibit spatial dependence—the tendency for observations at nearby locations to be more similar than distant observations—and spatial heterogeneity—systematic variation in relationships across space. Ignoring spatial dependence can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates, invalid inference, and incorrect policy conclusions, while failing to account for spatial heterogeneity can result in misspecified models that mask important local variations. Spatial econometric methods provide tools to model and test for these spatial patterns, to estimate models that incorporate spatial interactions, and to interpret results in ways that properly account for spatial spillovers and feedback effects. The book covers several classes of spatial models: the spatial autoregressive (SAR) or spatial lag model, which includes a spatially lagged dependent variable to capture spillovers where outcomes in one location directly affect outcomes in neighboring locations; the spatial error model (SEM), which allows for spatial correlation in the error term to account for unobserved spatially correlated factors; the spatial Durbin model (SDM), which includes both a spatial lag of the dependent variable and spatial lags of the independent variables, providing a flexible specification that nests SAR and SEM as special cases; and spatial panel models that extend these specifications to panel data with both spatial and temporal dimensions. A key methodological contribution emphasized throughout the book is the proper interpretation of spatial models through impact measures rather than naive inspection of regression coefficients. In spatial models with feedback loops, a change in an explanatory variable in one location affects not only the outcome in that location (the direct effect) but also outcomes in other locations through spatial spillovers (the indirect effect), and those spillover effects feed back to the original location, creating a spatial multiplier. The total effect is the sum of direct and indirect effects and represents the full impact of a variable change accounting for all spatial interactions. The authors develop formulas for computing these impact measures from estimated spatial models and provide software implementations that make the calculations accessible to practitioners. The book also covers practical issues in spatial econometric modeling: the construction and choice of spatial weight matrices that define the connectivity structure among observations, including contiguity-based weights, distance-based weights, and k-nearest-neighbor weights, along with guidance on how the choice of weights affects results and how to conduct sensitivity analysis; estimation methods for spatial models, including maximum likelihood, instrumental variables, and Bayesian approaches, with discussion of computational algorithms and software; specification testing to determine which spatial model is most appropriate for a given application, including tests for spatial dependence, tests for spatial error correlation, and model selection criteria; and handling of endogeneity, measurement error, and other econometric challenges in spatial settings. Applications covered in the book span regional economics, urban economics, real estate, transportation, environmental economics, and development economics, illustrating how spatial econometric methods can be applied to diverse empirical questions. The book provides numerous worked examples with real data and code, making it accessible to graduate students and applied researchers. Theoretical foundations are developed rigorously but with an emphasis on intuition and practical implementation rather than mathematical abstraction. The contribution of this work is to provide a unified and accessible treatment of spatial econometric methods that bridges theory and practice, to establish best practices for estimating and interpreting spatial models, and to equip researchers with the tools needed to properly account for spatial interactions in empirical work. The book has become a standard reference in spatial econometrics and is widely used in graduate courses and applied research. It has been particularly influential in promoting the use of impact measures for interpreting spatial models, which has become the standard approach in the literature and has corrected widespread misinterpretations of spatial regression coefficients. The methods and software developed in this book have been applied in thousands of studies across economics, geography, regional science, and related fields, and they have improved the rigor and credibility of empirical research on spatial phenomena. For researchers using nighttime lights and other spatially referenced data to study regional growth, convergence, and inequality, the spatial econometric methods covered in this book are essential tools for properly modeling spatial dependence, testing for spillovers, and interpreting results in ways that account for spatial feedback effects.;,citation_author=James P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Spatial econometrics: Methods and models;,citation_abstract=This foundational book establishes the theoretical and methodological framework for spatial econometrics, providing rigorous treatments of spatial dependence, spatial heterogeneity, and the econometric challenges they pose, along with maximum likelihood and instrumental variables estimation methods for spatial models. The work is motivated by the observation that classical econometric methods, which assume independent and identically distributed observations, are often inappropriate for spatial data where observations are inherently interconnected through geographic proximity, economic linkages, or social networks. Spatial dependence violates the independence assumption and can arise from several sources: spatial spillovers where actions or outcomes in one location directly affect neighboring locations, common shocks that affect nearby locations similarly, and measurement error or aggregation that induces spatial correlation. Spatial heterogeneity refers to systematic variation in model parameters across space, reflecting differences in local conditions, institutions, or preferences. Both phenomena require specialized econometric methods to ensure consistent and efficient estimation and valid inference. The book develops the spatial autoregressive model as a core framework, where the dependent variable in one location depends on the dependent variable in neighboring locations through a spatial lag term, and the strength of spatial dependence is governed by a spatial autoregressive parameter and a spatial weight matrix that defines the connectivity structure. The spatial weight matrix is a key modeling choice that encodes assumptions about which locations interact and how strongly, and the book discusses various specifications including binary contiguity weights, inverse distance weights, and row-standardized weights that ensure each row sums to one. The spatial error model is developed as an alternative specification where spatial correlation enters through the error term rather than the dependent variable, which is appropriate when spatial dependence arises from unobserved spatially correlated factors rather than direct spillovers. The book also introduces the spatial Durbin model and other extensions that allow for richer patterns of spatial interaction. Estimation methods are a central focus: the book derives maximum likelihood estimators for spatial models, showing that ordinary least squares is inconsistent in the presence of spatial lags of the dependent variable due to endogeneity, and developing concentrated likelihood functions that can be maximized numerically. Instrumental variables and two-stage least squares methods are also developed as alternatives that can provide consistent estimates under certain conditions. The book addresses computational challenges in spatial econometrics, including the need to compute determinants of large matrices and to handle sparse weight matrices efficiently, and it provides algorithms and approximations that make estimation feasible for large datasets. Specification testing is covered extensively: the book develops Lagrange multiplier tests for spatial dependence that can be computed from OLS residuals and used to test whether spatial models are needed, tests for spatial error correlation versus spatial lag dependence to guide model selection, and tests for spatial heterogeneity and parameter instability across space. These tests have become standard diagnostic tools in applied spatial econometrics. The book also discusses issues of spatial heterogeneity and spatial regimes, where parameters vary systematically across regions, and it develops methods for estimating and testing regime-switching models. Applications to regional economics, urban economics, and real estate are used throughout to illustrate the methods and to motivate the theoretical developments. The contribution of this work is to provide the first comprehensive and rigorous treatment of spatial econometric theory and methods, to establish the mathematical and statistical foundations for spatial regression models, and to develop practical estimation and testing procedures that can be implemented by applied researchers. The book has been foundational for the field of spatial econometrics and has influenced generations of researchers working on spatial data. It established key concepts such as spatial weight matrices, spatial autoregressive processes, and the importance of accounting for spatial dependence in econometric modeling, and it provided the theoretical basis for subsequent methodological advances including Bayesian spatial models, spatial panel methods, and spatial models for limited dependent variables. For researchers using nighttime lights and other spatial data to study regional development, the methods developed in this book are essential for properly modeling spatial interactions, for testing whether spatial dependence is present, and for ensuring that parameter estimates and inference are valid in the presence of spatial correlation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Measuring urban economic density;,citation_abstract=This paper develops methods for measuring urban economic density using nighttime lights data and applies these methods to study the spatial structure of cities, the relationship between density and productivity, and the evolution of urban form over time. The motivation is that urban economic density—the concentration of economic activity per unit area—is a fundamental determinant of productivity, innovation, and agglomeration economies, but it is difficult to measure accurately using traditional data sources such as employment surveys or establishment censuses, which are often unavailable at fine spatial scales or for many cities in developing countries. Nighttime lights provide a spatially continuous measure of economic activity that can be used to construct density measures at high resolution and for large samples of cities globally. The paper addresses several methodological challenges in using lights to measure urban density: defining urban boundaries consistently across cities and over time, aggregating pixel-level lights data to city-level measures in ways that capture density rather than just total activity, and validating lights-based density measures against ground-truth economic data. The approach to defining urban boundaries uses a threshold-based method where contiguous pixels with lights above a certain intensity are classified as urban, and connected urban pixels are grouped into urban agglomerations. The threshold is calibrated using data from cities with known boundaries to ensure that the lights-based boundaries correspond reasonably well to administrative or functional definitions of cities. Alternative boundary definitions are also explored, including using population density grids and combining lights with other remote sensing data such as land cover. Once urban boundaries are defined, the paper constructs several density measures: total lights within the urban area divided by the area (average density), lights within the central business district or urban core (core density), and measures of density gradients that capture how density declines with distance from the city center. These measures are computed for a large global sample of cities over multiple years, enabling cross-sectional comparisons and time-series analysis of density changes. Validation exercises compare lights-based density measures to establishment-level employment density and GDP per square kilometer for cities where such data are available, finding strong positive correlations (typically 0.6 to 0.8) that support the use of lights as a density proxy. The paper also examines how the lights-density relationship varies across cities with different income levels, industrial structures, and urban forms, finding that the relationship is stronger in cities with more formal economies and better electrification. Empirical applications using the density measures include studying the relationship between urban density and city-level productivity, testing whether denser cities have higher GDP per capita or wages after controlling for other city characteristics, and analyzing how density evolves as cities grow, including whether cities are becoming more or less dense over time and whether density gradients are flattening or steepening. The findings indicate that urban density as measured by lights is positively associated with productivity and income, consistent with agglomeration theories, and that density patterns vary systematically across regions and development levels, with cities in developing countries often exhibiting lower average density but steeper density gradients than cities in developed countries. The paper also documents trends in urban density over time, finding that many cities have experienced declining average density (urban sprawl) but increasing core density (re-urbanization of central areas), and that these trends vary across regions and city sizes. Methodological contributions include the development of replicable procedures for defining urban boundaries and computing density measures from nighttime lights, the validation of lights-based density measures against economic data, and the creation of a global panel dataset of urban density measures that is made publicly available for use by other researchers. The paper also discusses limitations and caveats: lights-based density measures are imperfect proxies that may not capture all forms of economic activity, particularly in informal or non-electrified sectors; the choice of urban boundary definition and density measure can affect results, so sensitivity analysis is important; and changes in lighting technology over time may affect the comparability of density measures across years. Despite these limitations, the paper demonstrates that nighttime lights provide a valuable tool for measuring urban economic density at scales and for samples of cities that are not feasible with traditional data sources. The contribution is to develop and validate methods for using lights to measure urban density, to apply these methods to study the spatial structure and evolution of cities globally, and to provide a publicly available dataset that enables further research on urbanization, agglomeration, and city growth. The findings have implications for urban economics, development policy, and infrastructure planning, highlighting the importance of density for productivity and the need to understand how urban form is changing over time in response to economic growth, technological change, and policy interventions.;,citation_author=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Combining satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty;,citation_abstract=This paper develops a machine learning approach that combines high-resolution daytime satellite imagery with nighttime lights data to predict poverty at fine spatial scales in data-scarce regions, demonstrating that transfer learning from deep convolutional neural networks can extract features from satellite images that are highly predictive of economic outcomes. The motivation is that traditional poverty measurement relies on household surveys, which are expensive, infrequent, and often lack the spatial resolution needed for targeting interventions, particularly in developing countries where poverty is concentrated and where survey coverage is weakest. Nighttime lights have been used as a proxy for economic activity, but they have limited ability to predict poverty in rural areas where much economic activity does not generate nighttime illumination and where lights data have low signal-to-noise ratios. High-resolution daytime satellite imagery captures information about infrastructure, housing quality, agricultural land use, and other features that correlate with poverty, but manually extracting these features from imagery is labor-intensive and not scalable. The key innovation is to use transfer learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pre-trained on large image datasets to automatically extract features from daytime satellite imagery, and then to use these features to predict economic outcomes. The methodology involves several steps: first, nighttime lights data are used to train a CNN to predict lights intensity from daytime imagery, leveraging the fact that lights are available globally and can serve as a noisy proxy for economic activity; second, the trained CNN is used to extract high-dimensional feature representations from daytime imagery for locations where survey data on consumption or assets are available; third, these features are used as inputs to a ridge regression model that predicts survey-based poverty measures, with the model trained on survey locations and then applied to predict poverty at unobserved locations. The transfer learning approach exploits the idea that features learned to predict nighttime lights from daytime imagery—such as roads, buildings, vegetation, and land use patterns—are also informative about poverty, even though the CNN was not directly trained on poverty data. The empirical application focuses on five African countries (Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda) where Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data provide cluster-level measures of asset wealth and consumption. High-resolution daytime imagery from commercial satellites (DigitalGlobe) at 0.5-meter resolution is obtained for survey clusters and surrounding areas, and nighttime lights from DMSP and VIIRS are aggregated to the same locations. The CNN architecture is based on a pre-trained VGG network that has been trained on millions of labeled images for object recognition tasks, and the network is fine-tuned to predict nighttime lights from daytime imagery using a large sample of image-lights pairs. The extracted features are then used to predict DHS asset wealth indices and consumption expenditure, and the model’s out-of-sample prediction accuracy is evaluated using cross-validation. The main findings indicate that the CNN-based approach substantially outperforms simpler methods that use only nighttime lights or hand-crafted features from daytime imagery: the R-squared for predicting cluster-level asset wealth increases from around 0.3 using lights alone to around 0.6 using CNN features, and prediction errors (RMSE) are reduced by 30 to 50 percent. The method performs particularly well in rural areas where nighttime lights are weak or absent, demonstrating that daytime imagery captures poverty-relevant information that lights miss. The paper also shows that the learned features correspond to interpretable aspects of the built and natural environment, such as road density, roof materials, vegetation cover, and agricultural land use, which are known correlates of poverty. The approach is scalable and can be applied to produce high-resolution poverty maps for entire countries or regions at relatively low cost, since satellite imagery is increasingly available and the computational cost of applying a trained CNN is modest. The paper produces poverty maps for the five study countries at 1-kilometer resolution, revealing substantial within-country spatial heterogeneity in poverty that is not captured by administrative statistics. These maps can be used for targeting social programs, infrastructure investments, and humanitarian assistance, and they provide a tool for monitoring poverty dynamics in near-real-time as new imagery becomes available. Methodological contributions include demonstrating the value of transfer learning for extracting features from satellite imagery in data-scarce settings, showing that nighttime lights can serve as a useful intermediate target for training models even when they are imperfect proxies for the ultimate outcome of interest, and providing a replicable framework that combines multiple satellite data sources with machine learning to predict socioeconomic outcomes. The paper also discusses limitations: the approach requires some ground-truth survey data for training, so it cannot be applied in areas with no surveys; the accuracy of predictions depends on the quality and resolution of satellite imagery, which varies across regions and over time; and the method predicts relative poverty or wealth within countries but does not directly estimate absolute poverty rates or monetary consumption levels. Despite these limitations, the paper demonstrates that combining satellite imagery and machine learning can substantially improve poverty measurement in data-scarce environments, and it has inspired a growing literature on using remote sensing and machine learning for socioeconomic prediction. The contribution is to develop and validate a scalable method for poverty mapping that leverages multiple satellite data sources and modern machine learning techniques, to demonstrate the value of transfer learning for extracting information from imagery, and to produce high-resolution poverty maps that can inform policy and research. The work has been influential in promoting the use of machine learning and satellite data for development applications and has opened new avenues for measuring and monitoring poverty, inequality, and other socioeconomic outcomes at fine spatial scales.;,citation_author=Neal Jean;,citation_author=Marshall Burke;,citation_author=Michael Xie;,citation_author=W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Detecting the effects of wars in the caucasus regions of russia and georgia using radiometrically normalized DMSP-OLS nighttime lights imagery;,citation_abstract=This paper uses radiometrically normalized DMSP-OLS nighttime lights imagery to detect and quantify the economic impacts of armed conflicts in the Caucasus regions of Russia and Georgia, demonstrating that nighttime lights can serve as a high-frequency, spatially explicit indicator of conflict-induced economic disruption and recovery. The motivation is that armed conflicts cause substantial economic damage through destruction of infrastructure, displacement of populations, disruption of trade and production, and diversion of resources to military purposes, but measuring these impacts is challenging because traditional economic data such as GDP, employment, and household surveys are often unavailable, unreliable, or delayed in conflict-affected areas. Nighttime lights provide an objective, remotely sensed measure of economic activity that can be observed consistently before, during, and after conflicts, enabling researchers to track the economic consequences of violence at fine spatial and temporal scales. The study focuses on conflicts in Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia, and South Ossetia during the 1990s and 2000s, including the First and Second Chechen Wars and the 2008 Russia-Georgia War, which caused significant casualties and displacement and are known to have had severe economic impacts. The methodological approach uses radiometrically normalized DMSP-OLS data, which applies corrections to remove inter-satellite inconsistencies and to create a time series that is comparable across years and satellites. The normalization is based on invariant regions and regression-based calibration, similar to the inter-calibration methods developed by Elvidge and colleagues, and it ensures that changes in lights over time reflect true changes in economic activity rather than sensor artifacts. The analysis compares nighttime lights in conflict-affected regions to lights in control regions that were not directly affected by violence, using a difference-in-differences framework that estimates the causal effect of conflict on economic activity by comparing changes in lights in treated and control regions before and after conflict events. The spatial units of analysis are administrative districts (raions) within the Caucasus regions, and the temporal coverage spans 1992 to 2009, allowing observation of pre-conflict baselines, conflict periods, and post-conflict recovery. The main findings indicate that armed conflicts caused substantial and persistent declines in nighttime lights in affected regions: during the peak of the Second Chechen War (1999-2002), nighttime lights in Chechnya declined by approximately 50 to 70 percent relative to pre-conflict levels and relative to control regions, indicating severe economic disruption. Neighboring regions such as Ingushetia and Dagestan also experienced declines in lights, though smaller in magnitude, consistent with spillover effects from the conflict. The 2008 Russia-Georgia War caused sharp but more temporary declines in lights in South Ossetia and surrounding areas, with partial recovery observed within one to two years after the conflict ended. The paper also documents heterogeneity in conflict impacts across space: urban areas and areas with more intense fighting experienced larger declines in lights, while more remote or less affected areas showed smaller or no declines. Recovery patterns varied as well: some regions showed gradual recovery of lights in the post-conflict period, while others remained depressed for many years, suggesting persistent economic damage or continued instability. The analysis includes robustness checks such as alternative control group definitions, placebo tests using regions and time periods without conflicts, and sensitivity to different normalization methods, and the main results are robust across specifications. The paper also compares lights-based estimates of economic impacts to available official statistics and qualitative accounts of conflict damage, finding general consistency and supporting the validity of lights as a conflict impact measure. Methodological contributions include demonstrating the feasibility and value of using nighttime lights to study conflict economics, developing methods for radiometric normalization and difference-in-differences analysis with lights data, and providing a template for applying these methods to other conflict settings. The findings have implications for conflict research, humanitarian response, and post-conflict reconstruction: nighttime lights can provide timely information about where economic damage is most severe, can help target assistance and reconstruction efforts, and can be used to monitor recovery and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. The paper also highlights the potential for using lights to study other types of shocks and disasters, such as natural disasters, economic crises, and policy changes, where traditional data are lacking. Limitations include the coarse spatial resolution of DMSP data, which limits the ability to detect impacts in small or rural areas, and the fact that lights capture only certain types of economic activity and may not fully reflect welfare impacts such as casualties, displacement, or psychological trauma. Despite these limitations, the paper demonstrates that nighttime lights are a valuable tool for studying the economic consequences of conflicts and for providing objective, timely information in settings where traditional data are unavailable. The contribution is to develop and validate methods for using lights to detect conflict impacts, to provide empirical evidence on the economic costs of specific conflicts in the Caucasus, and to establish nighttime lights as a credible data source for conflict and disaster research.;,citation_author=Frank D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Detection of rural electrification in africa using DMSP-OLS night lights imagery;,citation_abstract=This paper develops methods for detecting rural electrification using DMSP-OLS nighttime lights imagery and applies these methods to track the expansion of electricity access in rural Africa, demonstrating that nighttime lights can serve as a cost-effective tool for monitoring electrification progress in regions where administrative data on electricity access are sparse or unreliable. The motivation is that access to electricity is a fundamental determinant of economic development, education, health, and quality of life, and tracking electrification progress is essential for evaluating energy policies, targeting investments, and monitoring progress toward development goals such as universal energy access. However, traditional data on electricity access come from household surveys and utility records, which are infrequent, expensive, and often lack the spatial and temporal resolution needed for detailed monitoring, particularly in rural areas of developing countries where electrification is expanding rapidly. Nighttime lights provide a spatially explicit, frequently updated indicator of illumination that can be used to infer electricity access, since the appearance of new lights in previously dark areas is a strong signal of electrification. The methodological challenge is to distinguish genuine electrification—the appearance of persistent lights due to new electricity connections—from noise, transient lights, and other sources of illumination such as fires or gas flares. The paper develops a detection algorithm that identifies pixels that transition from unlit to lit over time and applies filters to exclude transient or spurious lights. The algorithm uses multi-year time series of DMSP-OLS stable lights composites and defines a pixel as newly electrified if it was consistently dark (DN = 0 or very low) in early years and then becomes consistently lit (DN above a threshold) in later years, with the transition sustained over multiple years to ensure persistence. The threshold for defining &amp;amp;amp;quot;lit&amp;quot; is calibrated using ground-truth data from household surveys and utility records in selected countries, and sensitivity analysis explores how results vary with different threshold choices. The spatial focus is on rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, where electrification rates are low but increasing, and where official data on electricity access are often outdated or incomplete. The analysis uses DMSP data from 1992 to 2010 to track changes in rural lighting over nearly two decades. Validation of the detection algorithm compares lights-based electrification estimates to survey-based estimates of electricity access from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and other sources, finding moderate to strong correlations (0.5 to 0.7) at the district or regional level, which supports the use of lights as an electrification proxy. The validation also includes field visits and case studies in selected villages where electrification timing is known, confirming that the appearance of lights in satellite imagery corresponds to the timing of grid connections or off-grid electrification projects. The main findings indicate that rural electrification in Africa expanded substantially from 1992 to 2010, with the total lit area in rural regions increasing by approximately 50 to 100 percent in many countries, though starting from very low baselines. The spatial pattern of electrification shows that new lights tend to appear first along major roads and near existing urban centers, and then gradually spread to more remote areas, consistent with the expansion of grid infrastructure and the economics of electricity distribution. The paper also documents significant heterogeneity across countries: some countries such as South Africa, Ghana, and Kenya experienced rapid rural electrification, while others such as Chad, Niger, and the Democratic Republic of Congo showed little change in rural lighting, reflecting differences in economic growth, government policies, and infrastructure investments. The analysis identifies specific regions and districts that experienced electrification during the study period, providing spatially explicit information that can be used for targeting further investments and for evaluating the impacts of electrification programs. Methodological contributions include the development of a replicable algorithm for detecting electrification from nighttime lights, the validation of lights-based electrification measures against survey data, and the demonstration that lights can be used to monitor electrification progress at scales and frequencies not feasible with traditional data sources. The paper also discusses limitations: DMSP lights have coarse spatial resolution and limited sensitivity to dim lights, so they may miss small-scale or off-grid electrification in very rural areas; the detection algorithm requires multi-year data to ensure persistence, so it cannot detect very recent electrification; and lights capture outdoor illumination, which may not perfectly correspond to household electricity access if lighting is primarily indoors or if electricity is used for purposes other than lighting. Despite these limitations, the paper demonstrates that nighttime lights provide valuable information about rural electrification trends and spatial patterns, and it establishes a methodology that has been applied in subsequent research on energy access, infrastructure development, and the impacts of electrification on economic and social outcomes. The contribution is to develop and validate methods for using nighttime lights to monitor rural electrification, to document electrification trends in rural Africa over nearly two decades, and to provide a tool that can be used by policymakers, development agencies, and researchers to track progress toward universal energy access and to evaluate the effectiveness of electrification programs.;,citation_author=Brian Min;,citation_author=Kwawu Mensan Gaba;,citation_author=Ousmane Fall Sarr;,citation_author=Alassane Agalassou;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=22;,citation_doi=10.1080/01431161.2013.833358;,citation_volume=34;,citation_journal_title=International Journal of Remote Sensing;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=US regional income convergence: A spatial econometric perspective;,citation_abstract=This paper applies spatial econometric methods to the study of regional income convergence in the United States, demonstrating that accounting for spatial dependence substantially alters conclusions about convergence rates and patterns compared to conventional aspatial analyses. The motivation stems from the observation that regional economies are not isolated units but are interconnected through trade, migration, capital flows, and knowledge spillovers, which create spatial dependence in income levels and growth rates. Ignoring this spatial dependence in convergence regressions can lead to biased estimates of convergence speeds, incorrect inference about the significance of convergence, and misunderstanding of the mechanisms driving regional income dynamics. The paper uses per capita personal income data for US states from 1929 to 1994 to test for absolute and conditional convergence, employing both standard OLS regressions and spatial econometric models that explicitly account for spatial interactions. The spatial econometric approach constructs a spatial weight matrix based on geographic contiguity, where states that share a border are considered neighbors, and estimates spatial lag and spatial error models that allow for spillovers and spatial correlation. The main empirical findings indicate that spatial dependence is statistically significant and economically important in US regional income data: tests for spatial autocorrelation reject the null hypothesis of spatial independence, and spatial econometric models fit the data substantially better than aspatial OLS models. When spatial dependence is accounted for, the estimated convergence rate is faster than in OLS regressions, suggesting that conventional estimates understate the speed of regional convergence. The paper also finds evidence of spatial clustering in income levels and growth rates, with high-income states tending to be located near other high-income states and fast-growing states near other fast-growing states, consistent with spatial spillovers and regional growth poles. The spatial lag model indicates that a state’s income growth is positively affected by income growth in neighboring states, supporting the hypothesis that regional growth is spatially interdependent. The paper discusses the economic interpretation of spatial dependence in convergence regressions: positive spatial autocorrelation in income levels can arise from common shocks, similar economic structures, or spillovers of technology and demand across state borders, while spatial dependence in growth rates suggests that convergence is a regional process where lagging states catch up not only to the national average but also to their neighbors. Methodological contributions include demonstrating the importance of testing for and modeling spatial dependence in convergence studies, showing how spatial econometric methods can improve inference and understanding of regional growth dynamics, and providing a template for applying spatial econometrics to convergence analysis that has been widely adopted in subsequent research. The findings have implications for regional policy: if regional growth is spatially interdependent, then policies that promote growth in one region can have positive spillovers to neighboring regions, and regional development strategies should account for these spatial linkages. The paper also highlights the need for spatial econometric methods in empirical growth research more broadly, as spatial dependence is likely to be present in many cross-country and cross-region datasets. Limitations include the focus on a single country (the US) where data quality is high and spatial units are relatively homogeneous, which may limit generalizability to other contexts, and the use of simple contiguity-based weights, which may not fully capture the complex patterns of economic interaction across regions. Despite these limitations, the paper has been influential in establishing spatial econometrics as an essential tool for convergence analysis and in demonstrating that spatial dependence matters for understanding regional income dynamics. The contribution is to apply spatial econometric methods to a classic question in regional economics, to show that accounting for spatial dependence changes empirical conclusions about convergence, and to promote the use of spatial methods in growth and development research. The work has been widely cited and has inspired numerous studies that apply spatial econometric methods to convergence and growth in other countries and regions, including studies using nighttime lights and other spatially referenced data to examine subnational development dynamics.;,citation_author=Sergio J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Twin peaks: Growth and convergence in models of distribution dynamics;,citation_abstract=This paper develops a distribution dynamics approach to studying economic growth and convergence, moving beyond traditional regression-based convergence tests to examine the evolution of the entire cross-sectional income distribution over time. The motivation is that conventional convergence regressions, which test whether poor countries grow faster than rich countries, provide limited information about the shape and dynamics of the world income distribution and can miss important patterns such as polarization, club convergence, and the emergence of multiple modes in the distribution. The distribution dynamics approach treats the cross-sectional income distribution as the object of interest and uses stochastic kernel methods and transition matrices to characterize how the distribution evolves, allowing for rich patterns of mobility, persistence, and stratification that are not captured by simple convergence coefficients. The empirical analysis uses per capita GDP data for a large cross-section of countries over several decades and estimates transition probabilities that describe the likelihood of a country moving from one part of the income distribution to another over time. The key finding is the emergence of &amp;amp;amp;quot;twin peaks&amp;quot; in the world income distribution: rather than converging to a single mode as predicted by simple convergence theories, the distribution has become increasingly bimodal, with one peak at low income levels (poor countries) and another peak at high income levels (rich countries), and a thinning middle. This pattern suggests polarization and the formation of convergence clubs, where countries converge within groups (rich countries converge to each other, poor countries converge to each other) but diverge across groups, leading to a widening gap between rich and poor. The distribution dynamics framework reveals that mobility across income classes is limited: countries that start poor tend to remain poor, and countries that start rich tend to remain rich, with relatively few countries transitioning from the low-income peak to the high-income peak. This persistence and stratification are not evident in conventional convergence regressions, which focus on average tendencies rather than distributional dynamics. The paper also explores the role of initial conditions, policies, and institutions in determining which convergence club a country joins, finding that initial income, human capital, and institutional quality are important predictors of long-run income levels and of whether a country escapes the low-income trap. Methodological contributions include the development of stochastic kernel estimation methods for characterizing income distribution dynamics, the use of transition matrices to quantify mobility and persistence, and the demonstration that distributional approaches provide richer insights into growth and convergence than regression-based methods alone. The twin peaks finding has been influential in shaping the literature on growth and convergence, highlighting the importance of club convergence, poverty traps, and the role of initial conditions and institutions in determining long-run outcomes. The paper has also motivated subsequent work on spatial distribution dynamics, where researchers apply similar methods to study the evolution of regional income distributions within countries, often using nighttime lights and other spatially disaggregated data to examine subnational convergence and polarization. The findings have important policy implications: if the world income distribution is polarizing into rich and poor clubs, then policies aimed at promoting convergence must address the structural barriers that prevent poor countries from transitioning to the high-income club, such as low human capital, weak institutions, and limited access to technology and capital. The paper also suggests that within-club convergence may be easier to achieve than cross-club convergence, and that regional integration and cooperation among countries in similar income ranges may be effective strategies for promoting growth. Limitations include the focus on cross-country data, which may mask important within-country heterogeneity, and the reliance on GDP per capita as the sole measure of economic development, which does not capture other dimensions of welfare such as inequality, health, and education. Despite these limitations, the paper has been foundational for the distribution dynamics literature and has influenced how economists think about growth, convergence, and the evolution of global inequality. The contribution is to develop and apply distribution dynamics methods to the study of economic growth, to document the twin peaks pattern in the world income distribution, and to highlight the importance of club convergence and polarization in understanding long-run development.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Convergence;,citation_abstract=This paper provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of economic convergence across countries and regions, testing the neoclassical growth model’s prediction that poor economies should grow faster than rich economies and converge to similar income levels in the long run. The motivation is to test one of the central implications of the Solow growth model and its extensions: that diminishing returns to capital imply that economies with lower initial capital per worker (and thus lower income per capita) should have higher marginal products of capital and should therefore grow faster, leading to convergence in income levels over time. The paper distinguishes between absolute (unconditional) convergence, where all economies converge to the same steady state regardless of initial conditions or structural characteristics, and conditional convergence, where economies converge to their own steady states determined by factors such as savings rates, population growth, human capital, and institutions. The empirical analysis uses data on per capita GDP and income for large samples of countries and for regions within countries (US states, Japanese prefectures, European regions) over periods ranging from several decades to over a century. The main findings indicate that absolute convergence holds within relatively homogeneous groups such as US states, Japanese prefectures, and regions within European countries, where economies share similar technologies, institutions, and preferences: the estimated convergence rate is approximately 2 percent per year, meaning that economies close about 2 percent of the gap between their current income and their steady-state income each year, implying a half-life of about 35 years for income differences to be halved. However, absolute convergence does not hold for the full cross-section of countries: poor countries do not systematically grow faster than rich countries when all countries are pooled together, and the cross-country income distribution has not converged over the past century. This lack of absolute convergence across countries is consistent with the presence of large differences in steady states due to differences in savings rates, human capital, institutions, and other structural factors. The paper then tests for conditional convergence by including controls for determinants of steady-state income such as investment rates, education, and government policies, and finds strong evidence of conditional convergence: after controlling for these factors, poor countries do grow faster than rich countries, with convergence rates similar to those observed within homogeneous regions (around 2 percent per year). This finding supports the neoclassical growth model’s prediction that economies converge to their own steady states, and it implies that cross-country income differences persist because steady states differ, not because the convergence mechanism is absent. The paper also explores the role of human capital in convergence, finding that including measures of educational attainment improves the fit of convergence regressions and increases the estimated convergence rate, consistent with augmented Solow models that incorporate human capital as a factor of production. The analysis includes robustness checks such as alternative samples, time periods, and control variables, and the main conclusions are robust across specifications. Methodological contributions include the development of a standard empirical framework for testing convergence that has been widely adopted in subsequent research, the distinction between absolute and conditional convergence that clarifies the interpretation of convergence tests, and the use of regional data within countries to test convergence in settings where structural factors are more homogeneous. The findings have important implications for growth theory and policy: the evidence of conditional convergence supports the neoclassical growth model and suggests that policies that affect steady-state income—such as investments in physical and human capital, improvements in institutions, and sound macroeconomic management—are key to promoting long-run growth and reducing income gaps. The lack of absolute convergence across countries highlights the importance of addressing structural barriers to growth and the need for policies tailored to country-specific conditions. The paper also provides estimates of convergence rates that serve as benchmarks for evaluating growth performance and for calibrating growth models. Limitations include the reliance on cross-sectional regressions, which may suffer from omitted variable bias and endogeneity, and the focus on average convergence rates, which may mask heterogeneity across countries and time periods. Despite these limitations, the paper has been foundational for the empirical growth literature and has established convergence as a central topic in macroeconomics and development economics. The contribution is to provide rigorous empirical tests of convergence using diverse datasets, to distinguish between absolute and conditional convergence, and to estimate convergence rates that are consistent with neoclassical growth theory. The work has been highly influential and has shaped how economists think about growth, convergence, and the determinants of long-run income differences across countries and regions. For researchers using nighttime lights and other alternative data sources to study subnational convergence, the methods and findings of this paper provide a theoretical and empirical foundation and a set of benchmarks against which lights-based convergence estimates can be compared.;,citation_author=Robert J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Multiple regimes and cross-country growth behaviour;,citation_abstract=This paper develops and applies regression tree methods to identify multiple regimes or convergence clubs in cross-country growth data, demonstrating that the relationship between initial income and subsequent growth is not uniform across all countries but varies systematically depending on initial conditions such as income levels, literacy rates, and other structural characteristics. The motivation is that standard convergence regressions assume a single linear relationship between initial income and growth that applies to all countries, but this assumption may be inappropriate if countries follow different growth paths depending on their initial conditions, leading to multiple steady states or convergence clubs. The presence of multiple regimes implies that convergence may occur within clubs but not across clubs, and that policies effective in one regime may not be effective in another. The regression tree methodology is a nonparametric approach that recursively partitions the sample of countries into subgroups based on threshold values of conditioning variables, identifying regimes where the growth-initial income relationship differs. The algorithm searches over possible partitioning variables and threshold values to find splits that maximize the explanatory power of the model, and it continues splitting until further partitions do not significantly improve fit or until subgroups become too small. The resulting tree structure reveals the hierarchy of conditioning variables that determine which growth regime a country belongs to, and it provides a data-driven way to identify convergence clubs without imposing a priori assumptions about club membership. The empirical analysis uses cross-country data on GDP per capita growth and a range of initial conditions including income, literacy, investment rates, and other variables for a large sample of countries over the post-World War II period. The main findings indicate that the cross-country growth process is characterized by multiple regimes: the regression tree identifies several distinct subgroups of countries with different growth-initial income relationships, and the partitioning variables that define these regimes include initial income, literacy rates, and other measures of human capital and institutional quality. For example, the tree may split countries first on initial literacy, separating high-literacy countries (which exhibit convergence) from low-literacy countries (which do not), and then further split each group on initial income or other variables. Within each identified regime, there is evidence of convergence, but across regimes the growth patterns differ, consistent with the existence of convergence clubs. The paper also finds that the identified regimes correspond to economically meaningful groupings: high-income, high-literacy countries form one club with relatively high steady-state incomes and convergence within the club, while low-income, low-literacy countries form another club with lower steady states and slower or absent convergence. The regression tree approach reveals that the conditioning variables that determine club membership are primarily related to human capital and institutions, suggesting that these factors are critical for determining long-run income levels and growth trajectories. Methodological contributions include the introduction of regression tree methods to the growth and convergence literature, demonstrating that nonparametric methods can uncover heterogeneity and regime-switching behavior that linear models miss, and providing a flexible framework for identifying convergence clubs that does not require pre-specifying club membership or threshold values. The findings have important implications for growth theory and policy: the existence of multiple regimes and convergence clubs suggests that one-size-fits-all growth policies are unlikely to be effective, and that policies must be tailored to the specific regime or club a country belongs to. The paper also implies that escaping a low-growth regime may require addressing the structural factors (such as low human capital or weak institutions) that define the regime, and that incremental policy changes may be insufficient if they do not move a country across regime thresholds. The work has been influential in the growth literature and has motivated subsequent research on convergence clubs, threshold effects, and nonlinear growth dynamics, including studies that use spatial data and nighttime lights to identify regional convergence clubs within countries. Limitations include the sensitivity of regression tree results to sample composition and to the choice of splitting criteria, and the fact that the method identifies associations rather than causal relationships, so the conditioning variables that define regimes may be correlated with unobserved factors that are the true drivers of regime differences. Despite these limitations, the paper has made an important contribution by demonstrating that cross-country growth is characterized by multiple regimes and by providing a methodology for identifying and analyzing convergence clubs. The contribution is to develop and apply regression tree methods to identify multiple growth regimes in cross-country data, to provide evidence of convergence clubs defined by initial conditions such as literacy and income, and to highlight the importance of heterogeneity and nonlinearity in growth processes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Geography and poverty traps;,citation_abstract=This paper investigates the role of geography in determining long-run income levels and the existence of poverty traps, testing whether geographic factors such as climate, disease environment, and access to coasts and navigable rivers create structural barriers to development that trap countries in low-income equilibria. The motivation is that geographic factors are largely exogenous and predetermined, making them useful for identifying causal effects on development outcomes, and that understanding the role of geography is critical for designing policies to help countries escape poverty traps. The paper builds on the literature on institutions and geography as fundamental determinants of development, and it tests whether geography has direct effects on income or whether geographic effects operate primarily through institutions and other channels. The empirical approach uses cross-country regressions of income per capita on geographic variables such as distance from the equator, malaria prevalence, access to coasts, terrain ruggedness, and agricultural suitability, along with controls for institutions, human capital, and other factors. The analysis also explores nonlinear relationships and interactions between geography and other determinants to test for poverty trap dynamics, where geographic disadvantages may have larger effects at low income levels. The main findings indicate that geography has significant direct effects on income: countries located in tropical climates, with high malaria prevalence, far from coasts, and with rugged terrain tend to have lower income per capita, even after controlling for institutions and human capital. The magnitude of geographic effects is economically meaningful: for example, moving from a high-malaria to a low-malaria environment is associated with income gains of 30 to 50 percent, and access to coasts and navigable rivers is associated with substantial income advantages. The paper also finds evidence of nonlinear effects and interactions: geographic disadvantages have larger negative effects on income at low initial income levels, consistent with poverty trap dynamics where geographic barriers prevent poor countries from accumulating capital and adopting technologies that would allow them to escape low-income equilibria. The analysis explores mechanisms through which geography affects development, including effects on agricultural productivity (climate and soil quality), disease burden (malaria and other tropical diseases), transport costs (access to coasts and navigable rivers), and technology adoption (climate and disease may affect the suitability of technologies developed in temperate regions). The paper finds that all of these channels are important, and that geographic factors have both direct effects on productivity and indirect effects through their influence on institutions, human capital, and economic structure. The findings have important policy implications: if geography creates structural barriers to development, then overcoming these barriers may require targeted interventions such as investments in health (malaria control, disease eradication), infrastructure (roads, ports, irrigation), and technology adaptation (developing crop varieties and technologies suited to tropical conditions). The paper also suggests that geographic disadvantages can be partially offset by good institutions and policies, but that the costs of overcoming geographic barriers are substantial and may require sustained international support. The work contributes to the debate on the relative importance of geography versus institutions in determining development outcomes, providing evidence that both matter and that geography has direct effects that are not fully mediated by institutions. Methodological contributions include the use of exogenous geographic variables as instruments for identifying causal effects, the exploration of nonlinear relationships and poverty trap dynamics, and the decomposition of geographic effects into specific channels. Limitations include the reliance on cross-sectional data, which limits the ability to control for unobserved heterogeneity and to test dynamic predictions of poverty trap models, and the challenge of disentangling direct geographic effects from indirect effects operating through institutions and other endogenous factors. Despite these limitations, the paper has been influential in highlighting the role of geography in development and in motivating research on how to overcome geographic barriers to growth. The contribution is to provide rigorous empirical evidence on the role of geography in determining income levels and poverty traps, to identify specific geographic factors and mechanisms that affect development, and to inform policy debates about how to help geographically disadvantaged countries achieve sustained growth. The findings are relevant for researchers using nighttime lights and other spatial data to study regional development, as they highlight the importance of controlling for geographic factors when analyzing spatial patterns of economic activity and convergence, and they suggest that geographic disadvantages may contribute to persistent regional inequalities within countries as well as across countries.;,citation_author=David E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Natural resource abundance and economic growth;,citation_abstract=This paper investigates the relationship between natural resource abundance and economic growth, documenting the paradoxical finding that countries with abundant natural resources tend to grow more slowly than resource-poor countries, a phenomenon known as the &amp;amp;amp;quot;resource curse.&amp;quot; The motivation is that conventional economic theory predicts that natural resource endowments should be a blessing for development, providing export revenues, fiscal resources, and inputs for industrialization, but empirical evidence suggests that resource-rich countries often experience slower growth, higher volatility, and worse development outcomes than resource-poor countries. Understanding this paradox is important for policy and for theories of growth and development. The empirical analysis uses cross-country data on GDP per capita growth, natural resource exports as a share of GDP, and a range of control variables including initial income, investment rates, human capital, trade openness, and institutional quality for a large sample of countries over the period 1970 to 1990. The main finding is a robust negative relationship between resource abundance (measured by the share of primary exports in GDP) and economic growth: countries with higher shares of natural resource exports in 1970 experienced significantly slower growth over the subsequent two decades, even after controlling for other determinants of growth. The magnitude of the effect is substantial: a 10 percentage point increase in the resource export share is associated with a reduction in annual growth of about 0.7 to 1 percentage point. This negative relationship holds across various specifications, samples, and measures of resource abundance, and it is not driven by outliers or specific regions. The paper explores several potential mechanisms for the resource curse: Dutch disease effects, where resource booms appreciate the real exchange rate and crowd out manufacturing and other tradable sectors that are important for long-run growth; rent-seeking and corruption, where resource rents create incentives for unproductive activities and weaken institutions; volatility and macroeconomic instability, where dependence on volatile commodity prices leads to boom-bust cycles that disrupt investment and growth; and crowding out of human capital and entrepreneurship, where resource sectors absorb talent and capital that could be more productively employed in other sectors. The analysis provides evidence consistent with several of these mechanisms: resource-rich countries tend to have more appreciated real exchange rates, lower manufacturing shares, higher corruption, and more volatile growth. The paper also finds that the resource curse is not inevitable: countries with strong institutions, good governance, and diversified economies can avoid or mitigate the negative effects of resource abundance, suggesting that policies and institutions matter for how resource wealth is managed. The findings have important policy implications: resource-rich countries should invest resource revenues in human capital, infrastructure, and economic diversification; establish transparent and accountable mechanisms for managing resource wealth (such as sovereign wealth funds); and strengthen institutions to resist rent-seeking and corruption. The paper also suggests that international support and monitoring can help resource-rich countries avoid the resource curse. Methodological contributions include the documentation of the resource curse as a robust empirical regularity, the exploration of multiple mechanisms through which resources may harm growth, and the use of resource export shares as a measure of resource dependence that is less endogenous than measures based on resource stocks. Limitations include the reliance on cross-sectional growth regressions, which may suffer from omitted variable bias and reverse causality, and the challenge of disentangling the direct effects of resource abundance from the indirect effects operating through institutions, policies, and economic structure. Subsequent research has debated the robustness of the resource curse and has explored additional mechanisms and conditioning factors, but the basic finding of a negative resource-growth relationship has been confirmed in many studies. The contribution is to document the resource curse as an empirical phenomenon, to explore potential mechanisms, and to highlight the importance of institutions and policies in determining whether natural resources are a blessing or a curse for development. The findings are relevant for researchers using nighttime lights and other spatial data to study regional development, as resource-rich regions within countries may exhibit different growth patterns and convergence dynamics than resource-poor regions, and as the spatial distribution of resource extraction and resource revenues can be observed using satellite data and linked to local economic outcomes.;,citation_author=Jeffrey D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The colonial origins of comparative development: An empirical investigation;,citation_abstract=This paper investigates the long-run effects of colonial institutions on economic development, arguing that differences in colonial settlement patterns and the institutions established by colonizers have persistent effects on current income levels and institutional quality. The motivation is to identify the causal effect of institutions on development, which is challenging because institutions are endogenous and may be shaped by income, culture, and other factors. The paper uses variation in colonial institutions driven by differences in European settler mortality as an instrument for current institutions, exploiting the idea that in places where Europeans faced high mortality from diseases such as malaria and yellow fever, they established extractive institutions designed to extract resources without significant settlement, whereas in places with low mortality they established settler colonies with institutions that protected property rights and encouraged investment. The empirical strategy uses historical data on European settler mortality in colonies as an instrument for current institutional quality, measured by indices of property rights protection, rule of law, and constraints on executive power. The first-stage relationship shows that settler mortality is a strong predictor of current institutions: colonies with high settler mortality have worse institutions today, consistent with the hypothesis that mortality affected the type of institutions colonizers established. The second-stage relationship estimates the causal effect of institutions on current income per capita, using the instrumented institutions variable. The main finding is that institutions have a large and statistically significant causal effect on income: a one-standard-deviation improvement in institutional quality is associated with an increase in log income per capita of about 0.9, which translates to roughly a 2.5-fold difference in income levels. This effect is much larger than the effects of geography or other factors, suggesting that institutions are a fundamental determinant of long-run development. The paper also shows that once institutions are controlled for, geographic factors such as latitude and climate have little direct effect on income, implying that geography affects development primarily through its influence on institutions rather than through direct effects on productivity. The findings support the view that institutions are a key determinant of economic performance and that historical events such as colonization can have persistent effects on development through their impact on institutions. The paper explores the mechanisms through which colonial institutions persist: extractive institutions create vested interests and power structures that resist change, and they shape the evolution of political and economic systems over time, leading to path dependence. The analysis includes robustness checks such as alternative measures of institutions and income, different samples of countries, and tests for the validity of the settler mortality instrument, and the main conclusions are robust. Methodological contributions include the use of historical instruments to identify causal effects of institutions, the demonstration that colonial origins are an important source of variation in institutions, and the development of an empirical framework for studying the long-run effects of institutions on development. The findings have been highly influential in the institutions and development literature and have motivated a large body of research on the origins and effects of institutions, including studies that use nighttime lights and other spatial data to examine within-country variation in institutional quality and its effects on local development. Limitations include the focus on former colonies, which limits the generalizability of the findings to non-colonized countries, and the reliance on settler mortality as an instrument, which may not be valid if mortality affected development through channels other than institutions. Despite these limitations, the paper has been foundational for the institutions literature and has shaped how economists think about the determinants of long-run development. The contribution is to provide credible causal evidence that institutions matter for development, to identify colonial origins as an important source of institutional variation, and to demonstrate that historical events can have persistent effects on economic outcomes. The work is relevant for researchers studying regional development and convergence, as it highlights the importance of institutions and historical legacies in shaping spatial patterns of economic activity and suggests that within-country institutional variation may contribute to persistent regional inequalities.;,citation_author=Daron Acemoglu;,citation_author=Simon Johnson;,citation_author=James A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Night-time light data: A good proxy measure for economic activity?;,citation_abstract=This paper provides a systematic evaluation of nighttime lights as a proxy for economic activity by testing the correlation between lights and various economic indicators across different spatial scales, income levels, and economic structures, and by identifying the conditions under which lights are most and least reliable as an economic measure. The motivation is that while nighttime lights have been widely adopted as a proxy for GDP and economic activity in the economics literature, there has been limited systematic evaluation of when and where this proxy is valid, and under what conditions it may be misleading. Understanding the strengths and limitations of lights as an economic proxy is essential for proper interpretation of empirical results and for guiding researchers on when to use lights versus other data sources. The empirical analysis uses DMSP-OLS nighttime lights data and economic data including GDP, employment, wages, and industry composition for multiple countries and spatial scales, including national, regional, and metropolitan area levels. The paper estimates correlations between lights and economic indicators and explores how these correlations vary with income level, urbanization, economic structure (share of manufacturing, services, agriculture), and spatial scale. The main findings indicate that nighttime lights are strongly correlated with GDP and economic activity at national and regional scales in middle- and high-income countries, with correlations typically in the range of 0.7 to 0.9, supporting the use of lights as a proxy in these contexts. However, the lights-GDP relationship is weaker in low-income countries, in rural areas, and in regions with high shares of agricultural employment, where much economic activity does not generate nighttime illumination. The paper also finds that the lights-GDP relationship is nonlinear: at low levels of income and lights, the relationship is steep, meaning that small increases in lights correspond to large increases in GDP, while at high levels the relationship flattens, reflecting saturation in DMSP data and the fact that additional economic activity in wealthy areas may not generate proportional increases in lighting. The analysis explores heterogeneity across economic sectors: lights are most strongly correlated with manufacturing and services employment, which tend to occur in lit buildings and urban areas, and less correlated with agricultural employment, which occurs primarily during daylight in rural areas. The paper also finds that lights are better proxies for economic activity in urban areas than in rural areas, and that the correlation between lights and GDP is higher at larger spatial scales (national and regional) than at finer scales (local or grid-cell), likely because aggregation averages out measurement error and local idiosyncrasies. The findings have important implications for the use of lights in economic research: lights are a valid and useful proxy for GDP and economic activity in middle- and high-income countries, in urban areas, and at regional or national scales, but they should be used with caution in low-income countries, in rural areas, and at very fine spatial scales where the signal-to-noise ratio is low. The paper recommends that researchers validate lights-based measures against available economic data for their specific study area and context, and that they conduct sensitivity analyses to assess how results depend on the choice of lights versus other proxies. Methodological contributions include a comprehensive evaluation of the lights-GDP relationship across diverse contexts, the identification of factors that affect the validity of lights as an economic proxy, and practical guidance for researchers on when and how to use lights data. The paper also discusses the implications of the transition from DMSP to VIIRS, noting that VIIRS addresses some of the limitations of DMSP (such as saturation and coarse resolution) and may provide a more reliable proxy in contexts where DMSP performs poorly. Limitations of the study include the focus on cross-sectional correlations, which do not directly test the ability of lights to measure growth or changes in economic activity over time, and the reliance on aggregate economic data, which may not capture all dimensions of economic activity or welfare. Despite these limitations, the paper provides valuable evidence on the strengths and limitations of nighttime lights as an economic proxy and offers practical guidance for applied researchers. The contribution is to systematically evaluate the validity of nighttime lights as a proxy for economic activity across diverse contexts, to identify the conditions under which lights are most and least reliable, and to provide evidence-based recommendations for the use of lights in economic research. The work has been widely cited and has helped to establish best practices for using nighttime lights data in economics and related fields.;,citation_author=Charlotta Mellander;,citation_author=José Lobo;,citation_author=Kevin Stolarick;,citation_author=Zara Matheson;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=10;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0139779;,citation_volume=10;,citation_journal_title=PLOS ONE;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Monitoring economic development from space: Using nighttime light and land cover data to measure economic growth;,citation_abstract=This paper develops a method for monitoring economic development by combining nighttime lights data with land cover data to improve the measurement of economic activity and growth, particularly in rural and agricultural areas where lights alone provide weak signals. The motivation is that nighttime lights have been shown to correlate with GDP and economic activity, but they have important limitations: they capture primarily urban and industrial activity that generates nighttime illumination, and they provide little information about agricultural production, which is a major component of economic activity in many developing countries. Land cover data from satellite imagery can complement lights by providing information about agricultural land use, vegetation, and other features that are associated with rural economic activity. The paper proposes a composite index that combines nighttime lights intensity with land cover indicators such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), cropland area, and built-up area to create a more comprehensive measure of economic activity that captures both urban and rural components. The methodological approach estimates the relationship between the composite index and GDP using data from countries where both satellite data and reliable GDP statistics are available, and then applies the estimated relationship to predict GDP and economic growth in countries or regions where official statistics are weak or unavailable. The composite index is constructed as a weighted combination of lights and land cover variables, with weights estimated from regression models that relate the index to GDP. The paper tests several functional forms and weighting schemes, including linear combinations, multiplicative indices, and principal components analysis, to determine which specification best predicts GDP. The empirical analysis uses DMSP-OLS nighttime lights, MODIS land cover and NDVI data, and GDP data for a global sample of countries over the period 2000 to 2010. The main findings indicate that the composite index that combines lights and land cover data outperforms lights alone in predicting GDP, particularly in low-income countries and in countries with large agricultural sectors. The improvement in predictive accuracy is substantial: the R-squared for predicting GDP increases from around 0.6 using lights alone to around 0.75 using the composite index, and prediction errors (RMSE) are reduced by 20 to 30 percent. The composite index also performs better in predicting economic growth over time, capturing changes in agricultural productivity and rural development that are missed by lights alone. The paper demonstrates the value of the composite index by applying it to monitor economic development in several case study countries, including Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar, where official GDP statistics are considered unreliable. The composite index reveals spatial patterns of economic activity and growth that are consistent with qualitative knowledge and ground-truth observations, and it provides more plausible estimates of growth than official statistics in some cases. The findings suggest that combining multiple satellite data sources can substantially improve the measurement of economic activity and growth, and that land cover data are particularly valuable for capturing rural and agricultural components of the economy. Methodological contributions include the development of a composite index that integrates lights and land cover data, the demonstration that multi-source satellite data can improve economic measurement, and the provision of a replicable framework for monitoring development in data-scarce environments. The paper also discusses practical considerations for implementing the composite index, including data availability, computational requirements, and the need for periodic recalibration as satellite sensors and economic structures change. Limitations include the reliance on cross-sectional relationships between satellite data and GDP, which may not hold over time or across different contexts, and the challenge of validating the composite index in countries where official statistics are unreliable. Despite these limitations, the paper demonstrates that combining nighttime lights with land cover data can enhance economic measurement and monitoring, particularly in rural and agricultural settings. The contribution is to develop and validate a composite index that combines nighttime lights and land cover data to improve the measurement of economic activity and growth, to demonstrate the value of multi-source satellite data for development monitoring, and to provide a practical tool for researchers and policymakers working in data-scarce environments. The work has been influential in promoting the use of multiple satellite data sources for economic measurement and has inspired subsequent research on integrating diverse remote sensing data to capture different dimensions of economic activity.;,citation_author=Souknilanh Keola;,citation_author=Magnus Andersson;,citation_author=Ola Hall;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.08.017;,citation_volume=66;,citation_journal_title=World Development;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Estimation of gross domestic product at sub-national scales using nighttime satellite imagery;,citation_abstract=This paper develops methods for estimating gross domestic product (GDP) at subnational scales using nighttime satellite imagery, demonstrating that lights can be used to spatially disaggregate national GDP estimates and to produce GDP estimates for regions, states, and other subnational units where official statistics are not available. The motivation is that GDP data are typically available only at the national level or for large administrative units such as states or provinces, but many policy and research applications require GDP estimates at finer spatial scales such as counties, districts, or grid cells. Traditional methods for estimating subnational GDP rely on surveys, censuses, and administrative data that are expensive, infrequent, and often unavailable, particularly in developing countries. Nighttime lights provide a spatially explicit indicator of economic activity that can be used to allocate national GDP across space in proportion to lights intensity, under the assumption that brighter areas have higher economic output. The methodological approach estimates the relationship between nighttime lights and GDP using data from countries or regions where both are available, and then uses this relationship to predict GDP for areas where only lights data are available. The paper explores several estimation methods: simple proportional allocation, where national GDP is distributed across subnational units in proportion to their share of total lights; regression-based methods, where GDP is predicted from lights using estimated coefficients from a training sample; and hybrid methods that combine lights with other spatial data such as population density or land cover. The empirical analysis uses DMSP-OLS nighttime lights data and GDP data for the United States, where state-level and county-level GDP estimates are available from official sources, allowing validation of the lights-based estimates. The main findings indicate that nighttime lights are strongly correlated with GDP at state and county levels, with correlations typically above 0.8, and that lights-based GDP estimates are reasonably accurate: the root mean squared error for state-level GDP predictions is around 15 to 25 percent, and for county-level predictions it is around 30 to 40 percent. The accuracy of lights-based estimates varies across regions: estimates are more accurate in urban and industrialized areas where lights are a good proxy for economic activity, and less accurate in rural and agricultural areas where much economic activity does not generate nighttime illumination. The paper also finds that combining lights with population data improves the accuracy of GDP estimates, as population provides additional information about the spatial distribution of economic activity. The lights-based GDP estimates are used to produce spatially explicit GDP maps at fine resolution (1-kilometer grid cells), revealing the spatial distribution of economic activity within countries and highlighting economic clusters and disparities that are not visible in aggregate statistics. The paper demonstrates the value of these maps for policy applications such as targeting infrastructure investments, assessing regional inequality, and monitoring economic development. Methodological contributions include the development of replicable methods for estimating subnational GDP from nighttime lights, the validation of lights-based estimates against official GDP data, and the production of high-resolution GDP maps that are made publicly available. The paper also discusses limitations: lights-based GDP estimates are subject to measurement error and may not capture all forms of economic activity; the lights-GDP relationship may vary across countries and over time, requiring periodic recalibration; and the method assumes that the spatial distribution of lights reflects the spatial distribution of GDP, which may not hold perfectly in all contexts. Despite these limitations, the paper demonstrates that nighttime lights provide a valuable tool for estimating subnational GDP and for producing spatially explicit economic data that are not available from traditional sources. The contribution is to develop and validate methods for using nighttime lights to estimate GDP at subnational scales, to produce high-resolution GDP maps for the United States and other countries, and to demonstrate the value of satellite data for spatial economic analysis and policy applications. The work has been widely cited and has established nighttime lights as a standard tool for subnational GDP estimation, and the methods developed in this paper have been applied in numerous subsequent studies to estimate GDP for regions, cities, and grid cells around the world.;,citation_author=Paul C.

        <p>Using satellite nighttime light data as proxy for economic activity, Chanda and Kabiraj (2020, World Development) studied regional growth and convergence across 520 districts in India. Based on a reproducible open-science approach, this article builds on their work by confirming and extending their main findings in three fronts. First, we illustrate regional convergence patterns using an interactive web-based tool for satellite image visualization. Second, we assess the degree of spatial dependence in their main econometric specification. Third, we employ a spatial Durbin model to measure the role of spatial spillovers in the convergence process. Our results indicate that spatial spillovers significantly increase the speed of regional convergence. Overall, the results emphasize the role of spatial dependence in regional convergence through the lens of satellite imagery, interactive visualizations, and spillover modeling.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Regional economic growth and convergence are key concerns in developing countries, particularly in large federal states like India where spatial inequalities can threaten social cohesion and political stability. However, studying regional convergence patterns in developing countries has been historically challenging due to limited availability of consistent economic data at subnational administrative levels. The emergence of satellite nighttime light data as a proxy for economic activity has created new opportunities to analyze regional growth dynamics at granular geographic scales.</p>
<p>In an important contribution, <span class="citation" data-cites="chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence">Chanda and Kabiraj (<a href="#ref-chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> leveraged nighttime light data to document evidence of regional convergence across 520 districts in India between 1996 and 2010. Their analysis showed that poorer districts grew faster than richer ones during this period, suggesting a gradual reduction in spatial inequalities. However, their econometric approach did not account for potential spatial spillovers in the convergence process—the possibility that a district’s growth trajectory might be influenced not only by its own initial conditions but also by those of its neighbors.</p>
<p>In this context, this paper confirms and extends the study of <span class="citation" data-cites="chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence">Chanda and Kabiraj (<a href="#ref-chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> in three key methodological directions. First, we develop an interactive web-based visualization tool that allows researchers to dynamically explore spatial and temporal patterns in the nighttime light data. This tool facilitates the identification of converging regions and growth hotspots that may be difficult to detect in static representations. Second, we formally test for spatial dependence in both the dependent and independent variables of the convergence equations, highlighting that spatial autocorrelation is an inherent feature of satellite data and the regional convergence process. Third, we employ a spatial Durbin model that explicitly accounts for spatial spillovers, quantifying how neighborhood effects influence the speed of regional convergence.</p>
<p>Our results yield three main findings that advance our understanding of regional convergence in India. First, interactive visualization tools reveal clear spatial patterns in both the initial distribution and subsequent growth of nighttime lights. Second, formal tests of spatial dependence indicate that district-level economic trajectories are not independent of their neighbors. Third, accounting for spatial spillovers through the spatial Durbin model shows that the total convergence effect is substantially larger than previous non-spatial estimates would suggest. Specifically, spatial spillovers appear to accelerate the convergence process by creating additional channels through which lagging regions can catch up.</p>
<p>These findings have important implications for both research methodology and policy design. Methodologically, they demonstrate that conventional non-spatial approaches may significantly underestimate the speed of regional convergence by failing to account for inter-district spillovers. From a policy perspective, they suggest that the benefits of place-based development interventions may extend beyond target districts through spatial multiplier effects, potentially increasing their cost-effectiveness. The results also highlight the value of new data sources and methodological tools in advancing our understanding of regional economic dynamics in developing countries.</p>
<p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the data and methods, describing our use of nighttime light data as a proxy for economic activity and introducing the spatial Durbin model that forms the basis of our empirical strategy. We also detail our methodological extensions related to interactive visualizations, spatial dependence testing, and spillover modeling. Section 3 presents our empirical results, beginning with an interactive exploration of regional convergence patterns, followed by formal tests of spatial dependence, and concluding with estimates of direct and indirect convergence effects from the spatial Durbin model. Finally, Section 4 offers some concluding remarks.</p>

<p>One of the key challenges in studying economic growth in developing countries like India is the limited availability and reliability of data on aggregate economic activity at finer administrative levels beyond the state level. To address this issue, a growing body of literature, pioneered by <span class="citation" data-cites="henderson_storeygard_weil_lights">Henderson, Storeygard, and Weil (<a href="#ref-henderson_storeygard_weil_lights" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>, has utilized satellite nighttime light data as a proxy for economic activity at sub-national levels.</p>
<p>Nightlight data has been widely used to investigate economic growth and convergence across national and sub-national regions in various countries. For instance, <span class="citation" data-cites="adhikari_dhital_decentralization">Adhikari and Dhital (<a href="#ref-adhikari_dhital_decentralization" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> examine the impact of decentralization on regional convergence using nightlight data, while <span class="citation" data-cites="pinkovskiy_salaimartin_lights_poverty">Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin (<a href="#ref-pinkovskiy_salaimartin_lights_poverty" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> use nightlight data to adjudicate between national accounts and household surveys, finding that national accounts better capture aggregate economic growth. Similarly, <span class="citation" data-cites="lessmann_seidel_regional_inequality">Lessmann and Seidel (<a href="#ref-lessmann_seidel_regional_inequality" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> leverage nightlight data to estimate GDP per capita and income inequality globally. More broadly, <span class="citation" data-cites="gennaioli_etal_growth_regions">Gennaioli et al.

These variables are derived from nightlight data released by the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), based on observations from the DMSP/OLS satellites spanning the period from 1996 to 2010. To mitigate the issue of top-coding in light data, the NGDC released “radiance-calibrated” nighttime lights for eight specific years within this period. This dataset employs high magnification settings for low-light regions and low magnification settings for brightly lit areas. For this study, we utilize the “radiance-calibrated” nighttime lights data.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>In neoclassical growth models, such as the Solow model, it is argued that the per capita growth rate should be negatively correlated with a region’s initial endowment primarily due to diminishing returns to capital. Specifically, poorer regions, assuming similar technology and preferences, are expected to experience higher growth rates compared to their wealthier counterparts. Consequently, over the long run, regions with similar characteristics should converge to a common steady state. We would like to explore such convergence (denoted by <strong><span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-convergence</strong>) employing a Barro-style growth regressions framework. Equation (1) analyzes absolute convergence.</p>
<p><span id="eq-matrix-form-abs"><span class="math display">\[
\boldsymbol{g_t} =  \beta_1 \boldsymbol{x_{t-1}} +  \boldsymbol{\varepsilon_t}
\tag{1}\]</span></span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{g_t}\)</span> represents an <span class="math inline">\(N\text{-by-}1\)</span> vector of observations on NTL growth for each of the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> regions over the period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{x_{t-1}}\)</span> represents an <span class="math inline">\(N\text{-by-}1\)</span> vector of observations on the initial (log) level of NTL. The scalar <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is a regression coefficient that indicates the direction and strength of regional convergence. Finally, <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon_t}\)</span> represents a vector of idiosyncratic error terms.</p>
<p>While absolute convergence implies that districts converge to a common steady state, regions may differ in various aspects such as geography, socio-economic conditions, and policy implementation. To account for these differences, we include state dummies in our analysis to examine whether heterogeneity in state-specific institutions and policies influences the rate of convergence. Additionally, we control for the initial share of unlit pixels in districts to address any potential under-coding in nightlights data.</p>
<p>To further explore the determinants of district-level growth rates, we incorporate a range of geo-climatic controls alongside initial district-specific conditions related to demographics, human capital, and infrastructure. <a href="#eq-matrix-form-abs" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;1</a> explores conditional convergence.</p>

<section id="interactive-spatial-visualizations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interactive-spatial-visualizations">Interactive spatial visualizations</h3>
<p>Interactive visualizations of nighttime lights imagery offer distinct methodological advantages over static representations, particularly when analyzing temporal and spatial heterogeneity in economic activity. The dynamic nature of these visualizations enables researchers to simultaneously examine multiple dimensions of the data, including temporal variations in light intensity, the spatial distribution of economic activity, and the relationship between nighttime lights and other georeferenced variables. This interactivity is especially valuable when investigating economic phenomena that exhibit significant spatial and temporal variation, such as urbanization patterns, economic shocks, or regional development disparities. The ability to dynamically adjust visualization parameters, such as temporal ranges, spatial scales, and light intensity thresholds, allows for more nuanced exploration of economic patterns that might be obscured in static representations.</p>
<p>Google Earth Engine (GEE) substantially reduces the computational and technical barriers to creating such interactive visualizations, offering a particularly advantageous platform for economic research utilizing nighttime lights data. The platform’s browser-based integrated development environment facilitates the creation of interactive web applications without requiring extensive infrastructure or specialized software installation. This capability is especially valuable for reproducible research, as it enables the development of web applications that can be shared with other researchers or stakeholders, allowing them to interact with the data and verify findings independently. The platform’s ability to handle large-scale geospatial computations server-side, combined with its extensive catalog of pre-processed nighttime lights datasets, including the DMSP-OLS and VIIRS collections, significantly streamlines the workflow from raw data to interactive visualization. This computational efficiency is particularly beneficial when analyzing long time series or large geographic areas, which would be computationally intensive using traditional desktop-based approaches.</p>
<p>Interactive visualizations of nighttime lights data are particularly instrumental in identifying and analyzing patterns of regional convergence in luminosity, providing visual insights into economic convergence processes. Through dynamic visualization tools, researchers can track the evolution of light intensity across regions over time, effectively identifying areas that exhibit catch-up growth patterns - where initially dim regions progressively converge toward the luminosity levels of their brighter counterparts.</p>

<section id="spatial-dependence-testing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spatial-dependence-testing">Spatial dependence testing</h3>
<p>The analysis of regional convergence using nighttime light data requires explicit consideration of spatial dependence patterns across Indian districts. To formally test and account for such spatial relationships, we employ the global Moran’s I test and applied to the main variables of the convergence <a href="#eq-matrix-form-cond" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;2</a> . The Moran’s I test quantifies the degree of spatial autocorrelation among geographic units and can be expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
I=\frac{\sum_i \Sigma_j w_{i j} z_i \cdot z_j /\sum_i \Sigma_j w_{i j}}{\Sigma_i z_i^2 / n}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(z_i\)</span> represents the deviation of observation <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> from the mean, and <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij}\)</span> denotes the spatial weight between units <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. The Moran statistic can range from -1 to +1, with positive values indicating spatial clustering and negative values suggesting spatial dispersion.</p>
<p>The specification of the spatial weights matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{W}\)</span> is crucial for capturing the underlying spatial structure. We primarily employ a Queen contiguity matrix defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{W}=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
w_{11} &amp; w_{12} &amp; w_{13} &amp; \cdots &amp; w_{1 \mathrm{n}} \\
w_{21} &amp; w_{22} &amp; w_{23} &amp; \cdots &amp; w_{2 \mathrm{n}} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; w_{\mathrm{ij}} &amp; \vdots \\
w_{\mathrm{n} 1} &amp; w_{\mathrm{n} 2} &amp; w_{\mathrm{n} 3} &amp; \cdots &amp; w_{\mathrm{nn}}
\end{array}\right]
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij}=1\)</span> for districts sharing either a border or vertex and 0 otherwise. Following standard practice, we row-normalize the weights matrix.</p>
<p>The detection of significant spatial dependence would justify the use of spatial econometric techniques. In particular, <span class="citation" data-cites="ertur_koch_spatial_growth">Ertur and Koch (<a href="#ref-ertur_koch_spatial_growth" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="fischer_spatial_mrw">Fischer (<a href="#ref-fischer_spatial_mrw" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> argue that the spatial Durbin model can properly account for spatial spillovers in the convergence process. This methodological choice allows us to distinguish between direct effects of district characteristics and indirect effects operating through spatial channels.</p>

<section id="spatial-spillover-modeling" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spatial-spillover-modeling">Spatial spillover modeling</h3>
<p>Our spatial spillover modeling builds upon the spatial Solow growth model developed by <span class="citation" data-cites="ertur_koch_spatial_growth">Ertur and Koch (<a href="#ref-ertur_koch_spatial_growth" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="fischer_spatial_mrw">Fischer (<a href="#ref-fischer_spatial_mrw" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>, which extends the traditional Solow framework to account for technological interdependence across regions. The model considers an economy of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> subnational regions, each characterized by a Cobb-Douglas production function with constant returns to scale:</p>
<p><span id="eq-production"><span class="math display">\[
Y_{i t}=A_{i t} K_{i t}^{\alpha_{K}} H_{i t}^{\alpha_{H}} L_{i t}^{1-\alpha_{K} -\alpha_{H}}

The parameters <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_H\)</span> denote the output elasticities with respect to physical and human capital, respectively. A key innovation of this framework is the modeling of technological knowledge, which incorporates both internal and external factors:</p>
<p><span id="eq-technology"><span class="math display">\[
A_{i t}=\Omega_{t} k_{i t}^{\theta} h_{i t}^{\phi} \prod_{j \neq i}^{N} A_{j t}^{\rho W_{i j}}
\tag{4}\]</span></span></p>
<p>This specification captures three distinct components of technological progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>An exogenous component (<span class="math inline">\(\Omega_t\)</span>) representing the common stock of knowledge across regions</li>
<li>An embodied component (<span class="math inline">\(k_{i t}^{\theta} h_{i t}^{\phi}\)</span>) reflecting technology embedded in physical and human capital per worker</li>
<li>A spatial component (<span class="math inline">\(\prod_{j \neq i}^{N} A_{j t}^{\rho W_{i j}}\)</span>) capturing technological interdependence between regions</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this theoretical framework, <span class="citation" data-cites="ertur_koch_spatial_growth">Ertur and Koch (<a href="#ref-ertur_koch_spatial_growth" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> derived a spatial panel Durbin model that for regional spillovers across economies.

<p>In this model, <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{g_t}\)</span> represents an <span class="math inline">\(N\text{-by-}1\)</span> vector of observations on NTL growth for each of the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> regions over the period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{x_{t-1}}\)</span> represents an <span class="math inline">\(N\text{-by-}1\)</span> vector of observations on the initial (log) level of NTL.

<p>Before presenting the regression results, we conducted three exercises to visually illustrate the concepts of growth and convergence in nightlights. Firstly, we created an interactive map of India displaying regional luminosity levels for 1996 and 2010.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Secondly, we examine absolute convergence by constructing a scatterplot that depicts the relationship between per capita growth rates in nightlights (1996–2010) and the initial per capita nightlight levels (1996) at the district level.

Focusing on some of the poorest regions in the country, we demonstrate an increase in nighttime lights that aligns with our convergence hypothesis.</p>

<p>In this study, the spatial lag terms of luminosity per capita growth and initial luminosity per capita are computed by applying the Queen contiguity weight matrix. FigureX visually presents the relationship between local luminosity per capita growth rate and initial luminosity per capita and its spatial lag term, respectively. The strong positive spatial correlations observed between the variables and their neighboring regions suggest that regional convergence is not an isolated phenomenon, but rather a process intrinsically shaped by the influence of adjacent regions. The Moran’s I values of 0.644 and 0.739 for the variables, coupled with a statistically significant spatial autocorrelation in the error term, underscore the critical importance of spatial dependence in convergence research. These findings demonstrate that spatial interactions profoundly influence the convergence process, rendering it imperative to incorporate spatial effects in empirical analyses.</p>

<p>The regression results of <a href="#tbl-models" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a> provide evidence of both unconditional and conditional convergence across districts in India, with both conventional OLS and spatial econometric approaches indicating significant negative relationships between initial luminosity levels and subsequent growth rates.

<p>Importantly, the spatial Durbin model uncovers significant spatial spillover effects that are masked in traditional OLS estimations. These indirect effects, which capture the influence of neighboring districts’ initial conditions on a district’s growth rate, become increasingly prominent and statistically significant as we add controls and state fixed effects to our specifications. In our most comprehensive model, we find a significant indirect effect of -0.012, suggesting that a district’s growth trajectory is meaningfully influenced by the initial economic conditions of its neighbors. This finding highlights the importance of geographical proximity and spatial interactions in the convergence process.</p>
<p>The total impact of initial conditions on growth, combining both direct and spillover effects, is substantially larger when we account for spatial dependence. In our fully specified model, the total convergence effect in the spatial Durbin model (-0.037) is approximately 48% larger than the OLS estimate (-0.025). This difference, supported by better model fit statistics, indicates that conventional non-spatial approaches may significantly underestimate the speed of regional convergence by failing to capture the additional convergence channels created through spatial spillovers. These results emphasize that regional convergence in India operates not only through district-specific factors but also through significant spatial interactions between neighboring districts.</p>

<section id="better-luminosity-data-from-viirs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="better-luminosity-data-from-viirs">Better luminosity data from VIIRS</h3>
<p>Our analysis, following <span class="citation" data-cites="chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence">Chanda and Kabiraj (<a href="#ref-chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, relies on radiance-calibrated DMSP-OLS nighttime lights data covering the period 1996 to 2010. While this dataset has been widely validated as a proxy for economic activity <span class="citation" data-cites="henderson_storeygard_weil_lights chen_nordhaus_luminosity_gdp">(<a href="#ref-henderson_storeygard_weil_lights" role="doc-biblioref">Henderson, Storeygard, and Weil 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-chen_nordhaus_luminosity_gdp" role="doc-biblioref">Chen and Nordhaus 2011</a>)</span>, DMSP-OLS data suffer from well-documented limitations including top-coding in bright urban cores, lack of on-board calibration leading to inter-satellite inconsistencies, and blooming artifacts that spatially blur light sources beyond their true boundaries <span class="citation" data-cites="abrahams_etal_deblurring">(<a href="#ref-abrahams_etal_deblurring" role="doc-biblioref">Abrahams, Oram, and Lozano-Gracia 2018</a>)</span>. These measurement issues can attenuate the precision of convergence estimates, particularly in rapidly urbanizing districts where saturation may mask growth variation.</p>
<p>The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band, operational since 2012, represents a substantial improvement over DMSP-OLS along multiple dimensions. VIIRS offers finer spatial resolution (approximately 750 meters versus 2.7 kilometers), on-board radiometric calibration that provides consistent quantitative measurements, and a wider dynamic range that avoids saturation in urban areas while detecting dim lights in rural settlements <span class="citation" data-cites="elvidge_etal_viirs">(<a href="#ref-elvidge_etal_viirs" role="doc-biblioref">Elvidge et al. 2017</a>)</span>. Comparative evaluations have shown that VIIRS explains 10 to 15 percentage points more variation in subnational economic activity than DMSP-OLS <span class="citation" data-cites="chen_nordhaus_measurement_error">(<a href="#ref-chen_nordhaus_measurement_error" role="doc-biblioref">Chen and Nordhaus 2015</a>)</span>, and systematic assessments recommend VIIRS as the preferred product for cross-sectional and recent time-series studies <span class="citation" data-cites="gibson_etal_ntl_measurement">(<a href="#ref-gibson_etal_ntl_measurement" role="doc-biblioref">Gibson et al. 2021</a>)</span>. Future extensions of our convergence analysis using VIIRS data could yield more precise estimates of both direct and indirect effects, particularly in districts where DMSP saturation may have compressed the measured distribution of luminosity.</p>
<p>A practical challenge for extending long-run convergence studies is the discontinuity between DMSP (1992–2013) and VIIRS (2012–present) sensor eras. Recent harmonization efforts, notably the global harmonized nighttime light dataset by <span class="citation" data-cites="li_etal_harmonization">Li et al. (<a href="#ref-li_etal_harmonization" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, have created consistent 27-year time series by calibrating VIIRS observations to DMSP-equivalent units during the overlap period. Such harmonized datasets could enable the extension of our spatial Durbin analysis to more recent periods, allowing researchers to examine whether the convergence patterns and spatial spillovers documented here have persisted, accelerated, or changed in character as India’s economy has continued to transform.</p>
</section>
<section id="new-research-directions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-research-directions">New research directions</h3>
<p>While our analysis documents the average convergence effect and its spatial spillover component, the cross-sectional regression framework does not capture potential heterogeneity in convergence patterns across the income distribution. Distribution dynamics approaches, as pioneered by <span class="citation" data-cites="quah_twin_peaks">Quah (<a href="#ref-quah_twin_peaks" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span>, could reveal whether Indian districts are converging to a single steady state or forming distinct convergence clubs where districts converge within groups but diverge across them. The regression tree methods developed by <span class="citation" data-cites="durlauf_johnson_convergence_clubs">Durlauf and Johnson (<a href="#ref-durlauf_johnson_convergence_clubs" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span> for identifying multiple growth regimes could be combined with spatial econometric techniques <span class="citation" data-cites="rey_spatial_dynamics">(<a href="#ref-rey_spatial_dynamics" role="doc-biblioref">Rey and Montouri 1999</a>)</span> to examine whether geographic clusters of districts follow distinct convergence trajectories, potentially revealing spatial poverty traps or growth poles that are not visible in average convergence estimates.</p>
<p>A second important direction concerns the causal identification of the spillover channels that our spatial Durbin model captures in reduced form. While our estimates document significant indirect effects, the model does not identify whether these spillovers operate through infrastructure linkages, labor migration, technology diffusion, or market access channels. Quasi-experimental approaches, such as those employed by <span class="citation" data-cites="asher_novosad_rural_roads">Asher and Novosad (<a href="#ref-asher_novosad_rural_roads" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> to study the causal effects of rural road construction on structural transformation in India, could be embedded within spatial econometric frameworks to isolate specific spillover mechanisms. Understanding which channels drive the indirect convergence effects is critical for designing spatially targeted policies that can amplify positive spillovers.</p>
<p>Third, the growing availability of diverse satellite products and machine learning methods opens possibilities for richer measurement of regional economic activity. <span class="citation" data-cites="jean_etal_poverty_prediction">Jean et al. (<a href="#ref-jean_etal_poverty_prediction" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> demonstrated that combining high-resolution daytime imagery with nighttime lights through deep learning can substantially improve poverty prediction in data-scarce settings. Similarly, <span class="citation" data-cites="keola_etal_lights_poverty">Keola, Andersson, and Hall (<a href="#ref-keola_etal_lights_poverty" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> showed that integrating nighttime lights with land cover data improves economic measurement in agricultural areas where lights alone provide weak signals. As <span class="citation" data-cites="donaldson_storeygard_remotesensing">Donaldson and Storeygard (<a href="#ref-donaldson_storeygard_remotesensing" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> emphasize, the expanding ecosystem of satellite-derived data—including vegetation indices, built-up area detection, and high-frequency mobility indicators—offers opportunities to construct multi-dimensional proxies for regional economic activity that go beyond what nighttime lights alone can capture.</p>
</section>
<section id="research-reproducibility-and-open-science" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="research-reproducibility-and-open-science">Research reproducibility and open science</h3>
<p>The complexity of satellite-based economic research—involving multi-step data processing pipelines, spatial econometric estimation, and geographic visualization—makes reproducibility both challenging and essential. As <span class="citation" data-cites="donaldson_storeygard_remotesensing">Donaldson and Storeygard (<a href="#ref-donaldson_storeygard_remotesensing" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> note, the processing of satellite data requires careful documentation and sharing of code to ensure that results can be replicated and extended. Each methodological choice in the pipeline, from sensor inter-calibration to spatial weight matrix construction, can affect empirical conclusions <span class="citation" data-cites="gibson_etal_ntl_measurement">(<a href="#ref-gibson_etal_ntl_measurement" role="doc-biblioref">Gibson et al. 2021</a>)</span>, underscoring the need for transparent computational workflows that allow other researchers to verify and build upon published findings.</p>
<p>This article adopts a reproducible research approach through Quarto’s single-source publishing framework, where a single manuscript file generates multiple output formats—interactive HTML, journal PDF, and supplementary materials—from the same source. All computational analyses are documented in embedded notebooks that readers can inspect alongside the results they produce, creating a complete chain from raw data to published findings. The interactive web-based visualization tool, built on Google Earth Engine, allows researchers to independently explore the spatial and temporal patterns in the nighttime light data, facilitating verification of our visual findings and enabling new discoveries beyond what static representations can convey.</p>
<p>Open-source tools and cloud computing platforms are rapidly lowering the barriers to reproducible spatial economic research. Cloud-based computational notebooks, such as those developed by <span class="citation" data-cites="mendez_patnaik_notebook">Mendez and Patnaik (<a href="#ref-mendez_patnaik_notebook" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> for processing nighttime lights data, eliminate the need for specialized local software and provide accessible workflows for data ingestion, preprocessing, spatial analysis, and visualization. The combination of open data repositories, version-controlled code, and cloud computing infrastructure creates an ecosystem where the full analytical pipeline—from satellite imagery to econometric results—can be made transparent, verifiable, and extensible by the broader research community.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concluding-remarks">Concluding remarks</h2>
<p>This article examines regional convergence patterns across Indian districts using satellite nighttime light data, interactive visualizations, and spatial econometric modeling. Expanding on the work of <span class="citation" data-cites="chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence">Chanda and Kabiraj (<a href="#ref-chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, we developed an interactive web-based visualization tool that illustrates spatial and convergence patterns across Indian districts. Spatial autocorrelation tests confirm that spatial dependence is a fundamental characteristic of satellite data and the regional convergence process in India. Estimates from our spatial Durbin model indicate that incorporating spatial spillovers significantly increases the estimated speed of regional convergence. The total convergence effect in our fully specified model is approximately 36% larger than conventional non-spatial estimates of <span class="citation" data-cites="chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence">Chanda and Kabiraj (<a href="#ref-chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. This finding implies that non-spatial convergence models may considerably underestimate the speed of regional convergence. Additionally, it suggests that place-based development interventions may have broader impacts, as their benefits can extend to neighboring districts through spatial spillover effects.</p>
<p>These results have important implications for both research methodology and policy design in developing countries. From a methodological perspective, they highlight the value of combining new data sources, interactive geospatial visualization tools, and spatial econometric methods to better understand regional economic dynamics. From a policy standpoint, they suggest that regional convergence operates not just through district-specific factors, but through complex spatial interactions that create additional channels for catch-up growth. This spatial perspective is crucial for the analysis and design of policies aimed at reducing regional inequalities in developing countries.</p>

There were 593 districts in 2001, which rose to 640 districts in the 2011 census. To match the districts among two census files, we summed up the curved-out districts with their origin districts in the 2011 census files. Eight districts among 47 new districts were created by curving out some areas from multiple districts. Those new districts along with their multiple-origin districts were dropped from our sample. We dropped all the districts in the state of Assam where more than 50% of districts were created in that manner.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

First, we illustrate regional convergence patterns using an interactive web-based tool for satellite image visualization. Second, we assess the degree of spatial dependence in their main econometric specification. Third, we employ a spatial Durbin model to measure the role of spatial spillovers in the convergence process. Our results indicate that spatial spillovers significantly increase the speed of regional convergence.

<span id="cb1-60"><a href="#cb1-60" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-61"><a href="#cb1-61" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Regional economic growth and convergence are key concerns in developing countries, particularly in large federal states like India where spatial inequalities can threaten social cohesion and political stability. However, studying regional convergence patterns in developing countries has been historically challenging due to limited availability of consistent economic data at subnational administrative levels. The emergence of satellite nighttime light data as a proxy for economic activity has created new opportunities to analyze regional growth dynamics at granular geographic scales.</span>
<span id="cb1-62"><a href="#cb1-62" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-63"><a href="#cb1-63" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In an important contribution, @chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence leveraged nighttime light data to document evidence of regional convergence across 520 districts in India between 1996 and 2010. Their analysis showed that poorer districts grew faster than richer ones during this period, suggesting a gradual reduction in spatial inequalities. However, their econometric approach did not account for potential spatial spillovers in the convergence process—the possibility that a district's growth trajectory might be influenced not only by its own initial conditions but also by those of its neighbors.</span>
<span id="cb1-64"><a href="#cb1-64" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-65"><a href="#cb1-65" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In this context, this paper confirms and extends the study of @chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence in three key methodological directions. First, we develop an interactive web-based visualization tool that allows researchers to dynamically explore spatial and temporal patterns in the nighttime light data. This tool facilitates the identification of converging regions and growth hotspots that may be difficult to detect in static representations. Second, we formally test for spatial dependence in both the dependent and independent variables of the convergence equations, highlighting that spatial autocorrelation is an inherent feature of satellite data and the regional convergence process. Third, we employ a spatial Durbin model that explicitly accounts for spatial spillovers, quantifying how neighborhood effects influence the speed of regional convergence.</span>
<span id="cb1-66"><a href="#cb1-66" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-67"><a href="#cb1-67" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Our results yield three main findings that advance our understanding of regional convergence in India. First, interactive visualization tools reveal clear spatial patterns in both the initial distribution and subsequent growth of nighttime lights. Second, formal tests of spatial dependence indicate that district-level economic trajectories are not independent of their neighbors. Third, accounting for spatial spillovers through the spatial Durbin model shows that the total convergence effect is substantially larger than previous non-spatial estimates would suggest. Specifically, spatial spillovers appear to accelerate the convergence process by creating additional channels through which lagging regions can catch up.</span>
<span id="cb1-68"><a href="#cb1-68" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-69"><a href="#cb1-69" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>These findings have important implications for both research methodology and policy design. Methodologically, they demonstrate that conventional non-spatial approaches may significantly underestimate the speed of regional convergence by failing to account for inter-district spillovers. From a policy perspective, they suggest that the benefits of place-based development interventions may extend beyond target districts through spatial multiplier effects, potentially increasing their cost-effectiveness. The results also highlight the value of new data sources and methodological tools in advancing our understanding of regional economic dynamics in developing countries.</span>

<span id="cb1-71"><a href="#cb1-71" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the data and methods, describing our use of nighttime light data as a proxy for economic activity and introducing the spatial Durbin model that forms the basis of our empirical strategy. We also detail our methodological extensions related to interactive visualizations, spatial dependence testing, and spillover modeling. Section 3 presents our empirical results, beginning with an interactive exploration of regional convergence patterns, followed by formal tests of spatial dependence, and concluding with estimates of direct and indirect convergence effects from the spatial Durbin model. Finally, Section 4 offers some concluding remarks.</span>

<span id="cb1-76"><a href="#cb1-76" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-77"><a href="#cb1-77" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>One of the key challenges in studying economic growth in developing countries like India is the limited availability and reliability of data on aggregate economic activity at finer administrative levels beyond the state level. To address this issue, a growing body of literature, pioneered by @henderson_storeygard_weil_lights, has utilized satellite nighttime light data as a proxy for economic activity at sub-national levels.</span>
<span id="cb1-78"><a href="#cb1-78" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-79"><a href="#cb1-79" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Nightlight data has been widely used to investigate economic growth and convergence across national and sub-national regions in various countries. For instance, @adhikari_dhital_decentralization examine the impact of decentralization on regional convergence using nightlight data, while @pinkovskiy_salaimartin_lights_poverty use nightlight data to adjudicate between national accounts and household surveys, finding that national accounts better capture aggregate economic growth. Similarly, @lessmann_seidel_regional_inequality leverage nightlight data to estimate GDP per capita and income inequality globally. More broadly, @gennaioli_etal_growth_regions study regional convergence using per capita income data from 1,528 subnational regions across 83 countries, finding a convergence rate of about 2% per year.</span>

<span id="cb1-81"><a href="#cb1-81" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Nightlight data has been widely utilized in India across various contexts. For example, @cook_shah_nregs use nightlight data to analyze the impact of public welfare programs, while @jha_talathi_colonial_india examine the effects of colonial institutions, and @chanda_cook_demonetization investigate the impact of demonetization. @beyer_jain_sinha_covid employ nightlight data to study the effects of COVID-19. In the context of convergence studies, @chakravarty_dehejia_gst document significant regional disparities in India using nightlight data and caution that GST may further exacerbate them, while <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence</span><span class="co">]</span> highlights district-level convergence.</span>

<span id="cb1-83"><a href="#cb1-83" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Our study draws inspiration from <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence</span><span class="co">]</span>. Following their approach, we use the per capita growth in nightlights as the dependent variable and the initial nightlights per capita as the primary variable of interest. These variables are derived from nightlight data released by the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), based on observations from the DMSP/OLS satellites spanning the period from 1996 to 2010. To mitigate the issue of top-coding in light data, the NGDC released "radiance-calibrated" nighttime lights for eight specific years within this period. This dataset employs high magnification settings for low-light regions and low magnification settings for brightly lit areas. For this study, we utilize the "radiance-calibrated" nighttime lights data.<span class="ot">[^1]</span></span>

<span id="cb1-85"><a href="#cb1-85" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">[^1]: </span>Following @chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence, our sample consists of 520 districts (out of a possible 593). There were 593 districts in 2001, which rose to 640 districts in the 2011 census. To match the districts among two census files, we summed up the curved-out districts with their origin districts in the 2011 census files. Eight districts among 47 new districts were created by curving out some areas from multiple districts. Those new districts along with their multiple-origin districts were dropped from our sample. We dropped all the districts in the state of Assam where more than 50% of districts were created in that manner.</span>

<span id="cb1-89"><a href="#cb1-89" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In neoclassical growth models, such as the Solow model, it is argued that the per capita growth rate should be negatively correlated with a region's initial endowment primarily due to diminishing returns to capital. Specifically, poorer regions, assuming similar technology and preferences, are expected to experience higher growth rates compared to their wealthier counterparts. Consequently, over the long run, regions with similar characteristics should converge to a common steady state. We would like to explore such convergence (denoted by **$\beta$-convergence**) employing a Barro-style growth regressions framework. Equation (1) analyzes absolute convergence.</span>

<span id="cb1-110"><a href="#cb1-110" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Interactive visualizations of nighttime lights imagery offer distinct methodological advantages over static representations, particularly when analyzing temporal and spatial heterogeneity in economic activity. The dynamic nature of these visualizations enables researchers to simultaneously examine multiple dimensions of the data, including temporal variations in light intensity, the spatial distribution of economic activity, and the relationship between nighttime lights and other georeferenced variables. This interactivity is especially valuable when investigating economic phenomena that exhibit significant spatial and temporal variation, such as urbanization patterns, economic shocks, or regional development disparities. The ability to dynamically adjust visualization parameters, such as temporal ranges, spatial scales, and light intensity thresholds, allows for more nuanced exploration of economic patterns that might be obscured in static representations.</span>

<span id="cb1-112"><a href="#cb1-112" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Google Earth Engine (GEE) substantially reduces the computational and technical barriers to creating such interactive visualizations, offering a particularly advantageous platform for economic research utilizing nighttime lights data. The platform's browser-based integrated development environment facilitates the creation of interactive web applications without requiring extensive infrastructure or specialized software installation. This capability is especially valuable for reproducible research, as it enables the development of web applications that can be shared with other researchers or stakeholders, allowing them to interact with the data and verify findings independently. The platform's ability to handle large-scale geospatial computations server-side, combined with its extensive catalog of pre-processed nighttime lights datasets, including the DMSP-OLS and VIIRS collections, significantly streamlines the workflow from raw data to interactive visualization. This computational efficiency is particularly beneficial when analyzing long time series or large geographic areas, which would be computationally intensive using traditional desktop-based approaches.</span>

The direct effects, representing within-district convergence, remain remarkably stable across specifications, ranging from -0.020 to -0.026.

These indirect effects, which capture the influence of neighboring districts' initial conditions on a district's growth rate, become increasingly prominent and statistically significant as we add controls and state fixed effects to our specifications. In our most comprehensive model, we find a significant indirect effect of -0.012, suggesting that a district's growth trajectory is meaningfully influenced by the initial economic conditions of its neighbors. This finding highlights the importance of geographical proximity and spatial interactions in the convergence process.</span>

<span id="cb1-209"><a href="#cb1-209" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The total impact of initial conditions on growth, combining both direct and spillover effects, is substantially larger when we account for spatial dependence. In our fully specified model, the total convergence effect in the spatial Durbin model (-0.037) is approximately 48% larger than the OLS estimate (-0.025). This difference, supported by better model fit statistics, indicates that conventional non-spatial approaches may significantly underestimate the speed of regional convergence by failing to capture the additional convergence channels created through spatial spillovers. These results emphasize that regional convergence in India operates not only through district-specific factors but also through significant spatial interactions between neighboring districts.</span>

While this dataset has been widely validated as a proxy for economic activity <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@henderson_storeygard_weil_lights; @chen_nordhaus_luminosity_gdp</span><span class="co">]</span>, DMSP-OLS data suffer from well-documented limitations including top-coding in bright urban cores, lack of on-board calibration leading to inter-satellite inconsistencies, and blooming artifacts that spatially blur light sources beyond their true boundaries <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@abrahams_etal_deblurring</span><span class="co">]</span>. These measurement issues can attenuate the precision of convergence estimates, particularly in rapidly urbanizing districts where saturation may mask growth variation.</span>

<span id="cb1-218"><a href="#cb1-218" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band, operational since 2012, represents a substantial improvement over DMSP-OLS along multiple dimensions. VIIRS offers finer spatial resolution (approximately 750 meters versus 2.7 kilometers), on-board radiometric calibration that provides consistent quantitative measurements, and a wider dynamic range that avoids saturation in urban areas while detecting dim lights in rural settlements <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@elvidge_etal_viirs</span><span class="co">]</span>. Comparative evaluations have shown that VIIRS explains 10 to 15 percentage points more variation in subnational economic activity than DMSP-OLS <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@chen_nordhaus_measurement_error</span><span class="co">]</span>, and systematic assessments recommend VIIRS as the preferred product for cross-sectional and recent time-series studies <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@gibson_etal_ntl_measurement</span><span class="co">]</span>. Future extensions of our convergence analysis using VIIRS data could yield more precise estimates of both direct and indirect effects, particularly in districts where DMSP saturation may have compressed the measured distribution of luminosity.</span>

<span id="cb1-220"><a href="#cb1-220" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>A practical challenge for extending long-run convergence studies is the discontinuity between DMSP (1992--2013) and VIIRS (2012--present) sensor eras. Recent harmonization efforts, notably the global harmonized nighttime light dataset by @li_etal_harmonization, have created consistent 27-year time series by calibrating VIIRS observations to DMSP-equivalent units during the overlap period. Such harmonized datasets could enable the extension of our spatial Durbin analysis to more recent periods, allowing researchers to examine whether the convergence patterns and spatial spillovers documented here have persisted, accelerated, or changed in character as India's economy has continued to transform.</span>

<span id="cb1-223"><a href="#cb1-223" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-224"><a href="#cb1-224" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>While our analysis documents the average convergence effect and its spatial spillover component, the cross-sectional regression framework does not capture potential heterogeneity in convergence patterns across the income distribution. Distribution dynamics approaches, as pioneered by @quah_twin_peaks, could reveal whether Indian districts are converging to a single steady state or forming distinct convergence clubs where districts converge within groups but diverge across them. The regression tree methods developed by @durlauf_johnson_convergence_clubs for identifying multiple growth regimes could be combined with spatial econometric techniques <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@rey_spatial_dynamics</span><span class="co">]</span> to examine whether geographic clusters of districts follow distinct convergence trajectories, potentially revealing spatial poverty traps or growth poles that are not visible in average convergence estimates.</span>
<span id="cb1-225"><a href="#cb1-225" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-226"><a href="#cb1-226" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>A second important direction concerns the causal identification of the spillover channels that our spatial Durbin model captures in reduced form. While our estimates document significant indirect effects, the model does not identify whether these spillovers operate through infrastructure linkages, labor migration, technology diffusion, or market access channels. Quasi-experimental approaches, such as those employed by @asher_novosad_rural_roads to study the causal effects of rural road construction on structural transformation in India, could be embedded within spatial econometric frameworks to isolate specific spillover mechanisms. Understanding which channels drive the indirect convergence effects is critical for designing spatially targeted policies that can amplify positive spillovers.</span>

<span id="cb1-228"><a href="#cb1-228" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Third, the growing availability of diverse satellite products and machine learning methods opens possibilities for richer measurement of regional economic activity. @jean_etal_poverty_prediction demonstrated that combining high-resolution daytime imagery with nighttime lights through deep learning can substantially improve poverty prediction in data-scarce settings. Similarly, @keola_etal_lights_poverty showed that integrating nighttime lights with land cover data improves economic measurement in agricultural areas where lights alone provide weak signals. As @donaldson_storeygard_remotesensing emphasize, the expanding ecosystem of satellite-derived data---including vegetation indices, built-up area detection, and high-frequency mobility indicators---offers opportunities to construct multi-dimensional proxies for regional economic activity that go beyond what nighttime lights alone can capture.</span>

<span id="cb1-232"><a href="#cb1-232" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The complexity of satellite-based economic research---involving multi-step data processing pipelines, spatial econometric estimation, and geographic visualization---makes reproducibility both challenging and essential. As @donaldson_storeygard_remotesensing note, the processing of satellite data requires careful documentation and sharing of code to ensure that results can be replicated and extended. Each methodological choice in the pipeline, from sensor inter-calibration to spatial weight matrix construction, can affect empirical conclusions <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@gibson_etal_ntl_measurement</span><span class="co">]</span>, underscoring the need for transparent computational workflows that allow other researchers to verify and build upon published findings.</span>

<span id="cb1-234"><a href="#cb1-234" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This article adopts a reproducible research approach through Quarto's single-source publishing framework, where a single manuscript file generates multiple output formats---interactive HTML, journal PDF, and supplementary materials---from the same source. All computational analyses are documented in embedded notebooks that readers can inspect alongside the results they produce, creating a complete chain from raw data to published findings. The interactive web-based visualization tool, built on Google Earth Engine, allows researchers to independently explore the spatial and temporal patterns in the nighttime light data, facilitating verification of our visual findings and enabling new discoveries beyond what static representations can convey.</span>
<span id="cb1-235"><a href="#cb1-235" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-236"><a href="#cb1-236" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Open-source tools and cloud computing platforms are rapidly lowering the barriers to reproducible spatial economic research. Cloud-based computational notebooks, such as those developed by @mendez_patnaik_notebook for processing nighttime lights data, eliminate the need for specialized local software and provide accessible workflows for data ingestion, preprocessing, spatial analysis, and visualization. The combination of open data repositories, version-controlled code, and cloud computing infrastructure creates an ecosystem where the full analytical pipeline---from satellite imagery to econometric results---can be made transparent, verifiable, and extensible by the broader research community.</span>

<span id="cb1-240"><a href="#cb1-240" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This article examines regional convergence patterns across Indian districts using satellite nighttime light data, interactive visualizations, and spatial econometric modeling. Expanding on the work of @chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence, we developed an interactive web-based visualization tool that illustrates spatial and convergence patterns across Indian districts. Spatial autocorrelation tests confirm that spatial dependence is a fundamental characteristic of satellite data and the regional convergence process in India. Estimates from our spatial Durbin model indicate that incorporating spatial spillovers significantly increases the estimated speed of regional convergence. The total convergence effect in our fully specified model is approximately 36% larger than conventional non-spatial estimates of @chanda_kabiraj_district_convergence. This finding implies that non-spatial convergence models may considerably underestimate the speed of regional convergence. Additionally, it suggests that place-based development interventions may have broader impacts, as their benefits can extend to neighboring districts through spatial spillover effects.</span>
<span id="cb1-241"><a href="#cb1-241" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-242"><a href="#cb1-242" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>These results have important implications for both research methodology and policy design in developing countries. From a methodological perspective, they highlight the value of combining new data sources, interactive geospatial visualization tools, and spatial econometric methods to better understand regional economic dynamics. From a policy standpoint, they suggest that regional convergence operates not just through district-specific factors, but through complex spatial interactions that create additional channels for catch-up growth. This spatial perspective is crucial for the analysis and design of policies aimed at reducing regional inequalities in developing countries.</span>
