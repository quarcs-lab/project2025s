    "Using satellite nighttime light data as proxy for economic activity, Chanda and Kabiraj (2020, World Development) studied regional growth and convergence across 520 districts in India. This article builds on their work by confirming and extending their main findings in three fronts. First, we illustrate regional convergence patterns using an interactive web-based tool for satellite image visualization. Second, we assess the degree of spatial dependence in their main econometric specification. Third, we employ a spatial Durbin model to measure the role of spatial spillovers in the convergence process. Our results indicate that spatial spillovers significantly increase the speed of regional convergence. Overall, the results emphasize the role of spatial dependence in regional convergence through the lens of satellite imagery, interactive visualizations, and spillover modeling.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Regional economic growth and convergence are key concerns in developing countries, particularly in large federal states like India where spatial inequalities can threaten social cohesion and political stability. However, studying regional convergence patterns in developing countries has been historically challenging due to limited availability of consistent economic data at subnational administrative levels. The emergence of satellite nighttime light data as a proxy for economic activity has created new opportunities to analyze regional growth dynamics at granular geographic scales.\n",

    "In an important contribution, @chanda2020 leveraged nighttime light data to document evidence of regional convergence across 520 districts in India between 1996 and 2010. Their analysis showed that poorer districts grew faster than richer ones during this period, suggesting a gradual reduction in spatial inequalities. However, their econometric approach did not account for potential spatial spillovers in the convergence process—the possibility that a district’s growth trajectory might be influenced not only by its own initial conditions but also by those of its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, this paper confirms and extends the study of @chanda2020 in three key methodological directions. First, we develop an interactive web-based visualization tool that allows researchers to dynamically explore spatial and temporal patterns in the nighttime light data. This tool facilitates the identification of converging regions and growth hotspots that may be difficult to detect in static representations. Second, we formally test for spatial dependence in both the dependent and independent variables of the convergence equations, highlighting that spatial autocorrelation is an inherent feature of satellite data and the regional convergence process. Third, we employ a spatial Durbin model that explicitly accounts for spatial spillovers, quantifying how neighborhood effects influence the speed of regional convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results yield three main findings that advance our understanding of regional convergence in India. First, interactive visualization tools reveal clear spatial patterns in both the initial distribution and subsequent growth of nighttime lights. Second, formal tests of spatial dependence indicate that district-level economic trajectories are not independent of their neighbors. Third, accounting for spatial spillovers through the spatial Durbin model shows that the total convergence effect is substantially larger than previous non-spatial estimates would suggest. Specifically, spatial spillovers appear to accelerate the convergence process by creating additional channels through which lagging regions can catch up.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings have important implications for both research methodology and policy design. Methodologically, they demonstrate that conventional non-spatial approaches may significantly underestimate the speed of regional convergence by failing to account for inter-district spillovers. From a policy perspective, they suggest that the benefits of place-based development interventions may extend beyond target districts through spatial multiplier effects, potentially increasing their cost-effectiveness. The results also highlight the value of new data sources and methodological tools in advancing our understanding of regional economic dynamics in developing countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the data and methods, describing our use of nighttime light data as a proxy for economic activity and introducing the spatial Durbin model that forms the basis of our empirical strategy. We also detail our methodological extensions related to interactive visualizations, spatial dependence testing, and spillover modeling. Section 3 presents our empirical results, beginning with an interactive exploration of regional convergence patterns, followed by formal tests of spatial dependence, and concluding with estimates of direct and indirect convergence effects from the spatial Durbin model. Finally, Section 4 offers some concluding remarks.\n",
