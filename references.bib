The empirical evidence is mixed and based mostly on developed countries due to a lack of income data for lower administrative regions. We combine night-lights data captured by satellites with a new database on decentralization derived from actual laws that are institutionalized and circumscribed from a global sample of countries. We then analyze the impact of decentralization on regional convergence using income data from the first and second administrative regions. We find that decentralization hinders within-country regional convergence, especially in the developing countries.},

Using night-lights per capita as a proxy for district-level per capita income, we find that modern districts that were historically under direct British rule had significantly fewer night-lights per capita in 1993 relative to modern districts that were historically under indirect British rule. The large gap persists even after including correlates of development such as educational attainment, health, and physical and financial infrastructure. Looking at the growth pattern from 1993 to 2013, directly ruled districts had a lower annual growth rate compared with that of indirectly ruled districts. Much of the development gap between areas under indirect rule and areas under direct rule can be accounted for by the adverse effect of landlord-based revenue-collection systems in the directly ruled areas.},

The method unifies two inequality decompositions by regional groups and gross regional product components (industrial sectors) and, therefore, enables us to assess the contributions of gross regional product components to within-region and between-region inequalities, as well as to overall inequality. As the share of mining has decreased, the spatial distribution of manufacturing has played a more important role in the inequality of Sumatra and Kalimantan, while the primacy of Jakarta, with strong urbanization economies, facilitated by globalization and trade and financial liberalization, has determined much of the Java-Bali region's inequality and, therefore, overall inequality in Indonesia. {\textcopyright}2011 The Authors.

Investments in human capital (education and health) seem to be the most effective way of increasing provincial incomes and reducing the disparities in provincial GDP per capita. The poorer provinces and rural areas can grow faster than the richer ones because they can gain the most from better health and education, as they have the highest rates of illiteracy, fertility, and infant, child and maternal mortality.},

The better performing regions include those that are the most 'connected' to the global economy. In this respect, Jakarta stands out, growing richer than the rest of the country over time. As expected, conflict is harmful to economic development. There is no clear natural resource story: the performance of the resource-rich provinces has varied considerably.},

abstract = {Why Should We Analyse Convergence Using the Distribution Dynamics Approach? - Paper first received, September 2007; in final form, September 2008 The convergence hypothesis has stimulated heated debate within the growth literature. The present paper compares the two most commonly adopted empirical approaches the regression approach and the distribution dynamics approach and argues that the former fails to uncover important features of the dynamics that might characterise the convergence process. In particular, the empirical section highlights the interpretational advantages stemming from the use of stochastic kernels to capture the evolution of the entire cross-sectional income distribution. Incidentally, comparison between the results obtained from alternative sets of Italian regions suggests that the use of administrative regions may lead to ambiguous results.

abstract = {Per capita income disparities, particularly evident between developed and less developed countries, are of noticeable importance even amongst the regions of the European Union and do not seem to reduce their extent following the predictions of the neoclassical model, despite the high degree of openness typical of regional economies. The empirical analysis of convergence among regions confronts two problems that, if not correctly addressed, can reduce the validity of the results. The first concerns the definition of region. Very often, in fact, empirical analyses within a regional context make use of the available data for administrative regions without adequately considering the consequent results of this choice. The second problem is related to the nature of the growth process. The methodology followed by the vast majority of researchers, i.e., cross-sectional regression, is based on the hypothesis of a growth process characterised by a smooth path towards a steady-state. As some authors have demonstrated empirically that this underlying hypothesis is invalid, it is interesting to develop an alternative methodology the results of which are not subject to this restrictive hypothesis on the growth process. The methodology suggested in this study focuses directly on the cross-sectional distribution of per capita income, modelling the growth process as a time homogeneous Markov chain. The methodology is then applied to per capita income data for 122 EU functional regions over the period 1979-1990.},

abstract = {This study examines data on regional inequality in Indonesia to help explain regional unrest. Analysis indicates that the New Order regime's equalization policies produced low levels of welfare inequality by transferring wealth from resource-rich provinces to poor communities on the one hand and to Jakarta on the other. Many in the subsidizing provinces resent this strategy which has held back their regions' development. They therefore exhibit an aspiration to inequality as they seek to stop such wealth transfer and to acquire greater control over their own resources. Yet policy emphasis on the economy over development of political institutions has left the political system with no effective means to address regional grievances, which are now manifest in vertical conflicts between the centre and the regions. We therefore propose a new philosophy for equalization policies. Rather than using a development fund to distribute wealth evenly across the regions, policy should aim to equalize people's opportunities and guarantee a minimum standard of basic services for all Indonesians, without impeding the growth potential of regions.},

The article documents this at various levels of disaggregation for a large sample covering more than 100 countries over recent decades. The result is highly robust to changes in the sample and specification. The coefficient of unconditional convergence is estimated quite precisely and is large, at between 2-3{\%} in most specifications and 2.9{\%} a year in the baseline specification covering 118 countries. The article also finds substantial sigma-convergence at the two-digit level for a smaller sample of countries. Despite strong convergence within manufacturing, aggregate convergence fails due to the small share of manufacturing employment in low-income countries and the slow pace of industrialization. Because of data coverage, these findings should be as viewed as applying to the organized, formal parts of manufacturing. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.

This result serves as a potential explanation to two stylized facts documented in the economic literature: the rising productivity dispersion within narrowly defined sectors, and the increasing market share of few yet highly productive firms. I further provide evidence suggesting that such pattern is driven by knowledge-intensive industries, for which cross-firm diffusion of knowledge is presumably more costly.},

We confirm that the estimated speeds of convergence are surprisingly similar across data sets: regions tend to converge at a speed of approximately two percent per year. We also show that the interregional distribution of income in all countries has shrunk over time. We then argue that, among the proposed potential explanations of this phenomenon, the one-sector neoclassical growth model (with no capital mobility or with partial capital mobility) and the hypothesis of technological diffusion seem to be the ones which survive scrutiny.},

A nonlinear time-varying factor model is adopted to examine convergence trends as the model allows for transitional heterogeneity and divergence from the actual growth path. The study further explores the driving forces of convergence clubs using an ordered response model. Four convergence clubs are identified, showing no geographic regularity in club member locations. The highest income club and the lowest income club tend to converge strongly, whereas two middle-income clubs converge weakly. The findings indicate that initial conditions, sectorial characteristics, preferential development policy, general government spending, network effect, spatial effect, and the role of globalization are the significant factors responsible for the formation of club convergence in China.},

This study investigates the determinants of Indonesia’s provincial growth of income per capita and discusses some issues related to the appropriate regional growth model estimation that utilizes GMM dynamic panel estimation. Gross regional domestic product (GRDP) per capita is the income proxy in this study, while several indicators, such as trade openness, infrastructure, and local government spending, serve as factors for growth. These are also supported by the usual determinants such as investment, human capital and population growth. The result points at transportation infrastructure, trade openness and human capital as important provincial growth determinants.}}
