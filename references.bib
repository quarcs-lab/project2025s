The empirical evidence is mixed and based mostly on developed countries due to a lack of income data for lower administrative regions. We combine night-lights data captured by satellites with a new database on decentralization derived from actual laws that are institutionalized and circumscribed from a global sample of countries. We then analyze the impact of decentralization on regional convergence using income data from the first and second administrative regions. We find that decentralization hinders within-country regional convergence, especially in the developing countries.},

Adjusting policies to contain transmission while mitigating the economic impact requires an assessment of the economic situation in near real-time and at high spatial granularity. This paper shows that daily electricity consumption and monthly nighttime light intensity can proxy for economic activity in India. Energy consumption is compared with the predictions of a consumption model that explains 90 percent of the variation in normal times. Energy consumption declined strongly after a national lockdown was implemented on March 25, 2020 and remained a quarter below normal levels throughout April. Part of the heterogeneity is explained by the prevalence of COVID-19 infections, the share of manufacturing, and return migration. During the national lockdown, higher COVID-19 infection rates at the district level were associated with larger declines in nighttime light intensity.},

Dividing districts further into rural and urban areas, the study shows that this catching-up can be attributed mainly to faster growth in rural areas. Additionally, geographically disadvantaged districts---those further away from the coast, with lower agricultural suitability, and more rugged terrain---also grew faster.}

Spatial externalities are found to be significant. This spatially augmented Solow model yields a conditional convergence equation which is characterized by parameter heterogeneity. A locally linear spatial autoregressive specification is then estimated providing a convergence speed estimate for each country of the sample.}

A system of 198 regions across 22 European countries over the period from 1995 to 2004 is used to empirically test the model. Testing is performed by assessing the importance of cross-region technological interdependence and measuring direct and indirect (spillover) effects of the MRW determinants on regional output.}

Regional convergence is faster in richer countries, and countries with better capital markets.

The large gap persists even after including correlates of development such as educational attainment, health, and physical and financial infrastructure. Looking at the growth pattern from 1993 to 2013, directly ruled districts had a lower annual growth rate compared with that of indirectly ruled districts. Much of the development gap between areas under indirect rule and areas under direct rule can be accounted for by the adverse effect of landlord-based revenue-collection systems in the directly ruled areas.},

We then calculate commonly used measures of regional inequality within countries and investigate changes in the dispersion of regional incomes over time, revealing that approximately 67--70\% of all countries experience sigma-convergence. We find an N-shaped relationship between development and regional inequality.

We find that the optimal weight on national accounts is substantially larger than the optimal weight on survey means. We conclusively reject the null hypothesis that the optimal weight on surveys is greater than the optimal weight on national accounts.

These data offer advantages over traditional economic indicators such as GDP, including greater spatial granularity, timeliness, lower cost, and comparability between regions regardless of statistical capacity or political interference. Despite these benefits, the use of NTL data in regional science has been limited. This is in part due to the lack of accessible methods for processing and analyzing satellite images. To address this issue, this paper presents a user-friendly geocomputational notebook that illustrates how to process and analyze satellite NTL images. The evolution of regional disparities in India is presented as an illustrative example. The notebook first introduces a cloud-based Python environment for visualizing, analyzing, and transforming raster satellite images into tabular data. Next, it presents interactive tools for exploring the space-time patterns of the tabulated data. Finally, it describes methods for evaluating the usefulness of NTL data in terms of their cross-sectional predictions, time-series predictions, and regional inequality dynamics.}

  abstract={A well-known difficulty with the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's nighttime lights series (DMSP-NTL 1992--2012) is that the images suffer from pervasive blurring, dubbed ``overglow'' or ``blooming.'' This paper devises a new method that significantly mitigates this blurring. First, by investigating the raw data from the satellite sensors, we discover that blurring is governed by a symmetric Gaussian point-spread function (PSF), but that the brightness of sources widens the PSF. Second, by recreating the satellite's data collection and storage process, we discover that any pixel containing a light source will tend to be lit at least as often as its neighbors, providing a second filter on the data. We use both insights to calibrate PSF dimensions for each part of the globe, each satellite, and each year, and then apply a Richardson-Lucy-type deconvolution to generate deblurred images. We show that our deblurred images more closely match high-resolution nighttime images from the VIIRS sensor, are more highly correlated with population counts, and are more effective predictors of local economic activity. The method is simple and computationally inexpensive, and we provide corrected data for all years from 1992 to 2013.}

  abstract={Remote sensing of night light emissions in the visible band offers a unique opportunity to directly observe human activity from space. This has allowed a host of applications including mapping urban areas, estimating population and GDP, monitoring disasters and conflicts. More recently, remotely sensed night lights data have found use in understanding the environmental impacts of light emissions (light pollution), including their impacts on human health. In this review, we outline the historical development of night-time optical sensors up to the current state of the art sensors, highlight various applications of night light data, discuss the special challenges associated with remote sensing of night lights with a focus on the limitations of current sensors, and provide an outlook for the future of remote sensing of night lights. While the paper mainly focuses on space borne remote sensing, ground based sensing of night-time brightness for studies on astronomical and ecological light pollution, as well as for calibration and validation of space borne data, are also discussed. Although the development of night light sensors lags behind day-time sensors, we demonstrate that the field is in a stage of rapid development. The worldwide transition to LED lights poses a particular challenge for remote sensing of night lights, and strongly highlights the need for a new generation of space borne night lights instruments. This work shows that future sensors are needed to monitor temporal changes during the night, and to better understand the angular patterns of light emission. Perhaps most importantly, we make the case that higher spatial resolution and multispectral sensors covering the range from blue to NIR are needed to more effectively identify lighting technologies, map urban functions, and monitor energy use.}

Despite the valuable records of nightscape from DMSP (1992--2013) and VIIRS (2012--2018), the potential of the historical archive of NTL observations has not been fully explored because of the severe inconsistency between DMSP and VIIRS. In this study, we generated an integrated and consistent NTL dataset at the global scale by harmonizing the inter-calibrated NTL observations from the DMSP data and the simulated DMSP-like NTL observations from the VIIRS data. The generated global DMSP NTL time-series data (1992--2018) show consistent temporal trends. This temporally extended DMSP NTL dataset provides valuable support for various studies related to human activities such as electricity consumption and urban extent dynamics.}

  abstract={Satellite nighttime light data are increasingly used for evaluating the performance of economies in which official statics are non-existent, limited, or non-comparable. In this paper, we use a novel luminosity-based measure of GDP per capita to study regional convergence and spatial dependence across 274 subnational regions of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) over the 1998-2012 period. Specifically, we first evaluate the usefulness of this new luminosity indicator in the context of ASEAN regions. Results show that almost 60 percent of the differences in (official) GDP per capita can be predicted by this luminosity-based measure of GDP. Next, given its potential usefulness for predicting regional GDP, we evaluate the spatio-temporal dynamics of regional inequality across ASEAN. Results indicate that although there is an overall (average) process of regional convergence, regional inequality within most countries has not significantly decreased. When evaluating the patterns of spatial dependence, we find increasing spatial dependence over time and stable spatial clusters (hotspots and coldspots) that are located across multiple national boundaries. Taken together, these results provide a new and more disaggregated perspective of the integration process of the ASEAN community.}

  abstract={The proliferation of large, complex spatial data sets presents challenges to the way that regional science---and geography more widely---is researched and taught. Increasingly, it is not `just' quantitative skills that are needed, but computational ones. However, the majority of undergraduate programmes have yet to offer much more than a one-off `GIS programming' class since such courses are seen as challenging not only for students to take, but for staff to deliver. Using evaluation criteria of minimal complexity, maximal flexibility, interactivity, utility, and maintainability, we show how the technical features of Jupyter notebooks---particularly when combined with the popularity of Anaconda Python and Docker---enabled us to develop and deliver a suite of three `geocomputation' modules to Geography undergraduates, with some progressing to data science and analytics roles.}

The retrieval algorithm, developed and implemented for routine global processing at the Land Science Investigator-led Processing System (SIPS), utilizes all high-quality, cloud-free, atmospheric-, terrain-, vegetation-, snow-, lunar-, and stray light-corrected radiances to estimate daily nighttime lights (NTL) and other intrinsic surface optical properties. Key algorithm enhancements include: (1) lunar irradiance modeling to resolve non-linear changes in phase and libration; (2) vector radiative transfer and lunar bidirectional surface anisotropic reflectance modeling to correct for atmospheric and BRDF effects; (3) geometric-optical and radiative transfer canopy modeling to account for seasonal variations in NTL; and (4) temporal gap-filling to reduce persistent data gaps. Extensive benchmark tests at representative spatial and temporal scales were conducted on the VNP46 time series record to characterize the uncertainties stemming from upstream data sources. Initial validation results are presented together with example case studies illustrating the scientific utility of these products.}

  abstract={There is a degree of uncertainty in the measurement and validation of national and sub-national economic data such as GDP. Nighttime satellite imagery showing the spatial distribution of lights has been shown to be a good proxy for the spatial distribution of economic activity at the national level. This paper explores the feasibility of developing predictive relationships between observed changes in nighttime satellite images from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and changes in population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We calibrate the relationship between nighttime lights and economic activity using data from the United States and apply this calibration to estimate sub-national GDP for other countries. Our estimates suggest that nighttime satellite imagery can provide reasonable approximations of sub-national economic activity in the absence of official statistics.}

  abstract={The use of nighttime lights (NTL) data to proxy for local economic activity is well established in remote sensing and other disciplines. Validation studies comparing NTL data with traditional economic indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), underpin this usage in applied studies. Yet the most widely cited validation studies do not use the latest NTL data products, may not distinguish between time-series and cross-sectional uses of NTL data, and usually are for aggregated units, such as nation-states or the first sub-national level, yet applied studies increasingly focus on smaller and lower-level spatial units. To provide more updated and disaggregated validation results, this study examines relationships between GDP and NTL data for 2657 county-level units in China, observed each year from 2012 to 2019. The NTL data used were from three sources: the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), whose time series was recently extended to 2019; and two sets of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data products. The first set of VIIRS products is the recently released version 2 (V.2 VNL) annual composites, and the second is the NASA Black Marble annual composites. Contrasts were made between cross-sectional predictions for GDP differences between areas and time-series predictions of economic activity changes over time, and also considered different levels of spatial aggregation.}

The recent proliferation of NTL sensors, algorithms, and products creates new opportunities to understand contemporary urbanization and the associated socioeconomic and environmental changes. We conducted a comprehensive literature review of 688 peer-reviewed papers published between 1992 and 2022 to understand the trends in how NTL data have been used to study urbanization (e.g., with which data products, during which time span, and in which geographies) and to synthesize the progress and challenges of key urban application topics. Based on our review, we identified four research directions for future NTL-based urban applications: (1) a better understanding of scale effects and sources of variations in NTL data; (2) integrating multi-source NTL data and synergizing NTL data with other types of geospatial data for improved NTL utilization; (3) more research on the Global South; and (4) developing new urban applications with new NTL data products. Addressing research gaps in these areas will generate new insights into the urbanization process under different geographical and socioeconomic settings.}

The analysis focuses on geographic income disparities at the sub-national level, using Mexico as a case study. By examining various a-spatial and spatially explicit approaches, the paper highlights the complexities of measuring inequality across places and over time. The discussion includes a review of traditional inequality measures and introduces spatial decomposition methods that account for the geographical distribution of income. The findings underscore the importance of integrating spatial considerations into inequality analysis to better understand the patterns and drivers of regional disparities, thereby informing more effective and equitable policy interventions.}
